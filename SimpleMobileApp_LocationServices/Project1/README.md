#Description 
A map of user’s location will appear with an add button to add a pin to the user’s current location.
When the user taps on the add button, the app will launch a new activity to input a title and a description for the pin. 
On the add screen, there will also be a button to allow the user to take a photo and add it to the add screen in an imageview.
When the user saves the location and image, the app will take the user back to the MapActivity and drop a new pin with the
new info and the picture.
