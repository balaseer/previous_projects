94|123906|2009-10-30 13:22:28|You can learn a lot about how people see you by how you're listed.  For example, it seems that people feel strongly that I work at Twitter.
94|123907|2009-10-30 04:08:35|I'm not sure when I switched from reading books in bed just before going to sleep to checking email, but I don't think it's healthy.
94|123908|2009-10-29 18:36:12|Another headphones cable on the fritz.  I need to buy these things in bulk.

94|123911|2009-10-27 15:33:45|Also, my iPhone just swapped better for heterosexual.  After all these years, sometimes I feel like you don't know me AT ALL, iPhone.
94|123912|2009-10-27 15:23:58|I'm beginning to think this day would have gone better if I had started it differently.  Mainly if I'd skipped the getting out of bed part.
94|123913|2009-10-27 02:12:13|I just finished season one of The Tudors, and omg you guys--you'll never believe how it ends!
94|123914|2009-10-26 19:45:39|Perhaps ideal for the undead.
94|123915|2009-10-26 19:44:38|It's a good thing I have this never-ending mountain of email to sort though.  Otherwise waiting on these tests would be boh-rring.
94|123916|2009-10-26 14:28:19|Setting up a translink card.  This process seems unduly complicated.
94|123917|2009-10-25 01:55:15|I want there to be substantially less waiting in my day to day life.
94|123918|2009-10-24 21:53:53|That sounds... bad.  You should go to a doctor.
94|123919|2009-10-23 22:26:15|Embroidery: cooler than you would think.
94|123920|2009-10-23 19:27:28|called me a pretty little hate machine.  It made me blush.
94|123921|2009-10-23 18:41:49|Don't cloud the wonder of this week with your little ...facts.
94|123922|2009-10-21 19:36:17|I block for misdirected replies.
94|123923|2009-10-21 14:12:31|No. I would burn alive contentedly at my laptop without ever having heard the fire alarm.
94|123924|2009-11-13 21:51:41|Finally figured it out.  There's only one escalator at this Bart station.  It changes direction depending on the time of day.
94|123925|2009-11-13 19:43:14|That looks really nice.  It's almost like we're a real company of grown-ups.
94|123926|2009-11-13 19:36:31|My new plates are so pretty, it makes me want to put better food on them.
94|123927|2009-11-12 22:42:30|Oh, sigh.  I always have to do things the hard way, don't I?
94|123928|2009-11-12 16:19:09|Oh sure, tell all the crazies.  Thanks a lot.
94|123929|2009-11-12 15:27:46|I'm watching the shipping casualty of this move hasten to its doom from the tracking page. Poor little guy. He has no idea what he's in for.
94|123930|2009-11-12 13:40:20|Theory: translink will only work on muni if you have $2  in your pocket as backup.
94|123931|2009-11-12 12:55:15|Wow.  Just... wow.
94|123932|2009-11-12 00:55:51|Took a chance on some molasses clove cookies.  Oh yeaaah, I live on the wild side.  And it's tasty here.
94|123933|2009-11-12 00:52:16|What timezone are you in?  Because if being up at 11pm makes you an insomniac then... *pats your head*
94|123934|2009-11-11 23:12:51|Yes, and then she loaned it to me.  But I can assure you, we both knew what we were getting into.

94|123936|2009-11-11 21:16:22|The prospect of a new office on Monday fills me with the kind of hope that scares me.  (That is, any.)
94|123937|2009-11-11 15:31:09|Just remembered my stressful dream.  I sure hope isn't mad at me still.
94|123938|2009-11-10 22:19:28|Well, hello fellow moocher.  Thanks for getting to it so quickly!
94|123939|2009-11-10 11:35:11|Today in cute: Cinder eats with his hands.  Scoops up each piece of kibble with his paw and head tilted, daintily dishes it into his mouth.
94|123940|2009-11-09 18:04:52|Nothing will make you realize just how dumb something is as trying to explain it to someone else.
94|123941|2009-11-09 15:38:23|The one thing that USPS has on UPS, FedEx and all other carriers:  the forwarding address.
94|123942|2009-11-09 13:53:48|We sincerely appreciate your feedback.  But please note, there is a 250 character limit.  Max exceeded.  Turns out I only needed four.
94|123943|2009-11-07 15:31:30|I'm going to be a full hour late to this thing.  My only excuse?  C'mon, it's Saturday.
94|123944|2009-11-06 23:18:51|Donated to a public artistic preformance for the first time in years.  It was both striking and silent.
94|123945|2009-11-06 21:00:57|I wish the iPhone wrong password error notice when unlocking your phone was a little less... mean.  Cut me some slack guys, it was a typo.
94|123946|2009-11-05 19:49:50|Thinking warm, congratulatory thoughts towards the people who made that thing happen.  You know who you are.
94|123947|2009-11-05 18:48:20|Never Forget.

94|123949|2009-11-05 16:23:10|Alright, that's it.  Today calls for cookies.
94|123950|2009-11-05 13:22:25|I need something to cheer me up from my somber contemplation.  Oh, this economics book will do quite nicely.  What?  Dismal is realtive.
94|123951|2009-11-05 13:11:36|. Yeah, everyone loves evernote. Only problem is, it's a great example of everything I don't want in my note taking app.
94|123952|2009-11-05 11:29:54|Wanted: a lightweight, fast, simple note taking web app that stores to the cloud and is on iphone.  Note: omnifocus does not qualify AT ALL.
94|123953|2009-11-04 21:38:22|That is exactly as it should be.
94|123954|2009-11-04 11:22:07|Whatever.  It'll be like paypal.  We'll just hire lots of laywers.
94|123955|2009-11-04 11:21:47|What ever happened to smelling salts anyway?  Oh.  Ammonia gas is toxic in large concentrations for prolonged periods, and can be fatal...
94|123956|2009-11-04 11:20:01|GENIUS money making idea:  An alarm clock that involves smelling salts.
94|123957|2009-11-03 12:07:49|Alright you guys, I let you have your fun.  But it's November--it's time to put the sun away now.
94|123958|2009-10-31 13:17:16|I don't get the hate people have for Nickelback. Sure, they're poppy and derivative--but since when does that inspire such rage?
94|123959|2009-10-31 02:06:12|Critical mass represents almost, but not quite everything that I hate about San Francisco.
94|123960|2009-10-30 16:57:03|I get that all the time.  I block the misguided souls so they no longer appear in my timeline.  (Their updates, not their souls.)
94|123961|2009-09-22 00:59:52|So, that thing is done.  Now, let's see.  All I have left to do is... oh my.  So, that thing is done.
94|123962|2009-09-22 18:10:25|The mid-afternoon fatal fatigue is upon me.  It's been nice knowing  you!
94|123963|2009-09-22 18:17:08|You may be kidding, but that is actually exactly how I found my lasik surgeon.  She was excellent, by the way.
94|123964|2009-09-22 18:29:37|Now that cloves are banned, I have to order them internationally at 1/10th the cost.  So, l'll smoke 10 times as much.  Thanks a lot Obama.
94|123965|2009-09-22 21:16:44|Yep.  http://bit.ly/dTZob
94|123966|2009-09-24 15:02:56|Just had a crappy customer service experience with  Calling  At least they charge less to treat you like crap.
94|123967|2009-09-25 12:54:51|Ok, kid. The pants-sagging-past-the-knees look was what gangstas were doing when *I* was a teenager.  Pfft. This generation. No creativity.
94|123968|2009-09-25 14:02:14|The USPS shipment status page says that my package arrived in San Francisco yesterday.  ...can has?  Can has please?
94|123969|2009-09-25 15:26:31|Just met in meatspace.  Don't believe me?  She threatened to steal a bus.  See?  Told you so.
94|123970|2009-09-25 17:07:47|Package was hand delivered by my very favorite  Eee hee hee heeee!  I has stuff!
94|123971|2009-09-25 17:24:35|Enjoying the view from the windy mountain road in our field trip bus, while pondering Twitter left in and hands if we crash.
94|123972|2009-09-25 21:14:14|Away from my computer for five hours, and my inbox is still empty.  What the... oh, right.
94|123973|2009-09-26 17:01:46|Well hello wrench.  Hey, wait!  What are you doing to my plans?!
94|123974|2009-09-26 23:11:39|Ladies and gentlemen, we are fast approaching the what-what-the-fuck-ever-just-shove-it-in-a-box portion of our moving journey. Buckle up.
94|123975|2009-09-27 16:17:29|That sounded like such a different topic until I got to bike shop.
94|123976|2009-09-27 16:25:04|A thirty hour move sprint.  Like yanking off a band aid.  Do you know I have a scar on my arm from yanking off a band aid?  It's true.
94|123977|2009-09-27 20:59:10|I'm rather fond of the god forsaken part.

94|123979|2009-09-27 21:26:11|The east bay has a large population of loud, small, insane humans.  The unnerving thing is that no one acts as though their behavior is odd.
94|123980|2009-09-27 21:27:47|Ok, ok, I know that doesn't sound different from San Francisco.  But they're small I tell you!  Like, three or four feet!
107|123981|2009-11-06 10:38:30|thanks!! I had fun making that video
107|123982|2009-11-06 10:36:45|100k emails per day or so
107|123983|2009-11-06 10:22:32|DynDNS too expensive -- I think Mobog.com alone sends out 100-150k+ emails per day
107|123984|2009-11-05 16:39:59|Anyone have an SMTP server I can use to send invites etc from my sites?  I don't want to run my own but don't want to pay. Can plug you.

107|123999|2009-10-29 02:26:23|Nope.  That's why they're called private companies.
107|124000|2009-10-28 14:33:39|The Hulkster can definitely get in on that mustache action.
107|124001|2009-10-28 13:11:36|Wish I could have been there! Sounds awesome.
107|124002|2009-10-28 13:11:14|Anyone know of a commenting system (Disqus, JS-Kit, IntenseDebate, etc) that I can integrate with my sites existing user ids?
107|124003|2009-10-27 16:52:57|Got in touch with them, thanks
107|124004|2009-10-27 12:44:02|Do you have a section for bears? :-)
107|124005|2009-10-27 05:19:59|lol
107|124006|2009-10-27 03:26:03|Anyone else think it's weird when a company boasts about their collective years of experience?  You don't have 500 years of experience!
107|124007|2009-10-26 20:01:33|I was told you might be able to intro me to someone at CritSend?  I need a reliable SMTP service for hitmelater.com and mobog.com
107|124008|2009-10-26 20:00:45|Do you have a simple SMTP service? Emails from my sites, HitMeLater.com and Mobog.com, don't make it through spam filters.
107|124009|2009-10-26 19:39:22|Gmail SMTP only allows 500 emails per day.  I don't know how many my sites send, but it's probably in the 10,000's.
107|124010|2009-10-26 19:34:51|Can I have an invite to your service?  My sites HitMeLater.com and Mobog.com need a better solution than running my own SMTP.
107|124011|2009-10-26 19:33:24|Thanks! Can you get me an invite to CritSend?
107|124012|2009-10-26 19:12:51|Does anyone know a cheap & reliable 3rd-party outgoing SMTP service?  High volume.  Tired of using (and maintaining) my own SMTP server.
107|124013|2009-10-26 00:18:13|My question (why is U2 so popular) was answered best by U2 is awesome for the same reason you love, say, Metallica. Touche.
107|124014|2009-10-26 00:10:00|The illustrations are really great. PS- I wish I could make it to Audience. I'm sure it will be awesome
107|124015|2009-10-26 00:04:12|Watching live U2 show on YouTube.  Great sound/video quality.  Still don't understand why this band is so popular though (u2 fans chime in)
107|124016|2009-10-25 22:14:59|Your new profile pic is awesome. Who illustrated it?
107|124017|2009-10-24 16:31:25|Just landed in Vegas. Btw, the Jay-Z track On to the Next One is HOT. Find it on YouTube or something.
107|124018|2009-10-24 02:09:55|Humiliated myself at makeup counter today. Say hypothetically you're a guy with a big zit, I mumbled. Thankfully they were sweet & helped.
107|124019|2009-10-23 03:08:05|Your show tonight in SF was amazing, incredible. Question: Who's your friend who came out and danced with you? That was awesome.
107|124020|2009-11-13 01:17:37|Cool. Also consider using the phrase Sign in instead of Log in. Less geeky. Also see Tripit.com for combo signin/signup box.
107|124021|2009-11-12 20:39:00|Whoa that table looks too awesome
107|124022|2009-11-12 15:32:21|I run small site that sends legit email. Hotmail spams my messages even tho SPF/RDNS is valid. Do you have a free solution?

107|124028|2009-11-09 11:14:13|My outgoing email gets lost because EC2 doesn't let me set reverse-DNS. Why? No choice but to move to somewhere like Slicehost.
107|124029|2009-11-08 18:26:40|Ah disregard my last comment -- I misunderstood. Yes! You have a point.
107|124030|2009-11-08 18:23:49|To what product/site of mine are you referring?
107|124031|2009-11-08 16:49:35|submit a better story and I'll put it on top!

107|124037|2009-11-07 16:43:43|For everyone who asked, no, I'm not planning on spamming. My many sites send lots of transactional emails (lost passwords, friend reqs etc)

107|124039|2009-11-07 16:18:06|One of my sites, Mobog.com, sends over 100,000 transactional emails per day. Needs beefier mail server.
107|124040|2009-11-07 15:56:00|Haha nah - my stupid old site Mobog.com alone sends over 100,000 transactional emails per day

107|124045|2009-11-06 15:17:32|100,000 emails per day.  Slicehost looks to be around $20/mo
107|124046|2009-11-06 14:48:42|One of my sites, Mobog.com, sends out about 100,000 transactional emails per day. Mobog is hosted on EC2 so the email never arrives.
107|124047|2009-11-06 14:44:18|What's a super-cheap place I can host an SMTP server?  Don't say Amazon EC2 (must support reverse-DNS for reliable email sending)

107|124051|2009-11-20 08:55:29|Is it just me, or do 50% of Google searches for people culminate in race results? If you ever ran a 5k, the internets will find you.

259|124287|2009-09-30 04:42:26|Diving back into C++. For some reason LLVM is hanging onto a function stub handle too long. Why isn't this in Haskell?

291|124328|2009-11-03 17:08:40|oooo! That's exciting.
291|124329|2009-11-03 16:53:03|FACT: I've never seen you quiet even when asleep.

291|124331|2009-11-06 20:07:24|Finding out from the cheeky #tipsforUKvisit tag that Cockfosters is a tube stop.
291|124332|2009-11-06 19:02:02|Aw. The airport's new fangled back-scatter wang viewer is down for maintenance. Probably went on the fritz after I last went through.
291|124333|2009-11-06 17:04:11|The only solution is aluminum underwear. Tough on the teeth.
291|124334|2009-11-06 16:32:27|Cracking up listening to curse his new phone. The unboxing video of this would be a great Andy Rooney segment.
291|124335|2009-11-06 16:30:20|More nuclei will be presented later. Cliffhangers are so fucking gimmicky.
291|124336|2009-11-06 15:34:44|Never give jawas coffee. It makes them hyper-scavenge.
291|124337|2009-11-06 10:44:54|yeah, that's not going to be detemined by number. Not gonna spoil the secret but (hint) if white kids are involved it's more tragic.
291|124338|2009-11-06 10:39:42|as a child, I learned that the universe was arbitrary and cruel because of the cancelation of that show.
291|124339|2009-11-06 01:53:15|So they've remade V and they're remaking The Prisoner. Got high hopes for seeing Kyle Maclachlan in Misfits of Science sometime next year.

291|124341|2009-11-05 19:47:44|The machine that may destroy the universe was busted by a baguette. We're almost at a Douglas Adams novel. http://bit.ly/3WI2oS

291|124343|2009-11-05 17:41:36|This #movember thing isn't working for me. Every patchy mustache I see reminds me of a prostate exam.
291|124344|2009-11-05 15:51:38|The dark epic fantasy role playing game Dragon Age Orgins.
291|124345|2009-11-05 15:43:22|yes! Oh, an reading lots of backstory text in submenus.
291|124346|2009-11-05 15:37:35|yes! It's good
291|124347|2009-11-05 14:45:26|saw it on wikipedia. They've done such a good job with their story that I thought it always existed. Like, the game is a sequel.
291|124348|2009-11-05 11:08:22|whoa. Were you getting married again?
291|124349|2009-11-05 10:55:11|PS3. Played through the starter chapter last night. I'm much more into the backstory than in the previous BioWarez.
291|124350|2009-11-12 17:23:46|Got caught in an adolescent subroutine when asked Are you packing anything funny? Still unresolved.
291|124351|2009-11-12 17:02:30|Nice! That is best poker show. Stoked for next season.

291|124358|2009-11-11 16:26:54|Nope - that's the old office. Monday is the first day in the new one.
291|124359|2009-11-11 15:11:03|I got served and I wasn't even involved!
291|124360|2009-11-11 13:05:01|and since we're moving we also have lots of cardboard boxes.
291|124361|2009-11-11 13:02:17|hahaha. We can't apply the same entry standards and balancing that y'all do at XS. None of us would ever get in!
291|124362|2009-11-11 12:35:43|Yeah, that group is a bit of a sausage-fest. We got some bgirls as well as bboys tho.
291|124363|2009-11-11 12:26:33|You'd be surprised to know that 1min after this picture was taken a breakdancing competition busted out  http://yfrog.com/j3t8muj

291|124370|2009-11-10 14:38:59|where's the details on that?
291|124371|2009-11-10 14:26:20|well, I looked for the forward to user feature but didn't find it. Weird.
291|124372|2009-11-10 14:11:43|Oh. You saw that? :)
291|124373|2009-11-10 12:56:35|So true. Nazi rapists have been misunderstood for years. We're talking about the folks who raped the Nazis, right?
291|124374|2009-11-10 12:36:51|Holy hell. You win every what are your hobbies conversation ever.
291|124375|2009-11-10 12:35:10|Never noticed that there's a Beal Bank in downtown SF before. Wonder if there's a good poker game inside.   http://yfrog.com/b9ijoxj
291|124376|2009-11-10 11:46:25|At the doctor for my physical. Early returns suggest I'll live until I don't.
291|124377|2009-11-09 15:24:47|holy shit. I am both jealous of your progress and scared that I won't ever be able to get even that far.
291|124378|2009-11-09 14:43:03|Goddamit. Wrong who's. Trickier than it's for me. Bullshit language.
291|124379|2009-11-09 14:42:04|you and Admiral Adama have differing ethical views on this. You can imagine who's side I'll take.
291|124380|2009-11-09 14:41:07|hope didn't weaken your immune system this weekend. That's not generally what we mean by go viral.
291|124381|2009-11-09 14:39:20|Pointing out to that there's no intrinsic conflict in being a vegan and a fan of UFC.
291|124382|2009-11-09 13:00:38|we barely survived! Chef made a special menu and I think and I had one of everything. Thanks for having us!
291|124383|2009-11-08 21:24:03|British means fantasy.
291|124384|2009-11-08 20:18:41|FACT: all ladies dislike the word moist which is why it's infinitely funny to immature dudes like me.
291|124385|2009-11-08 20:03:09|Pretty sure I could live forever if I had 30 minutes in a steam room everyday. I'd be like a moist vampire.
291|124386|2009-11-08 18:44:54|congrats on the new show! That's awesome.

291|124408|2009-11-20 22:02:10|that's the Astronomer Royal, jackass, one of the most famous astrophysicists in the world. It's like calling Hawking a science nerd.

897|125157|2009-11-05 07:14:24|Congrats to on Viewfinder 1.0. Quickly search and download from Flickr on your Mac: http://connectedflow.com/viewfinder/
897|125158|2009-11-04 21:55:45|Cool. Did MLB At Bat cover the series? I bought it for 2008 but not this year, didn't use it as much as I thought I would.
897|125159|2009-09-18 08:09:00|It's still a few months off for me, but I'm certainly interested.
897|125160|2009-09-18 09:09:00|Good to hear. How to balance iPhone and Mac, and which to emphasize, is a decision each developer should make for his or herself.
897|125161|2009-09-18 10:09:00|Cool tip. It's those little things in Coda that make me a fan.
897|125162|2009-09-18 12:09:00|Congrats on the release! Glad the new company is working out so well.
897|125163|2009-09-18 13:09:00|Oops, Phil's not one of the good guys? My opinion from a few months ago stands: the App Store is unfixable. Macworld: http://bit.ly/LTnRR
897|125164|2009-09-18 13:09:00|Right, they'll never do that. If we're lucky maybe they'll one day open up the device to non-App Store apps, but it's unlikely.
897|125165|2009-09-18 13:09:00|Time for me to take my own advice and shut up about the App Store. On a positive note: weather in Austin is nice and cool.
897|125166|2009-09-18 14:09:00|Thought experiment from what if Apple didn't pre-screen apps? To me, that'd change everything. Less risk, more control to devs.
897|125167|2009-09-18 14:09:00|I would love that too. In fact, I might prefer it, because it makes the device itself more open.
897|125168|2009-09-18 14:09:00|Agree completely. The App Store can remain exclusive and broken and it's perfectly fine, as long as it's not the only game in town.
897|125169|2009-09-18 16:09:00|I turn off the A/C while recording. Usually a mistake for Texas, but it does put a nice time limit on the podcast before I melt.
897|125170|2009-09-18 16:09:00|I posted a follow-up to your question about Clipstart: http://bit.ly/1piZB2 (Also, check Apple's 3rd-party promos site for a license.)
897|125171|2009-09-19 12:09:00|Well, I definitely give you points for trying something fun. :-) Good luck with the app.
897|125172|2009-09-19 15:09:00|Biked with the kids to a neighbor's snow cone stand. Only later did we realize the seller was playing with her pet rat before shaping ice.
897|125173|2009-09-19 15:09:00|Ugh, what is wrong with people. Glad they weren't successful.
897|125174|2009-09-20 00:09:00|I'll get this fixed right away, thanks for reporting it. Embarrassing. I also updated the forum post with more details.
897|125175|2009-09-20 01:09:00|Thanks. Export should improve quickly now that I'm hearing how people use it in the real world. Lots of good feedback.
897|125176|2009-09-20 01:09:00|Reminded tonight that I often forget to test my app under different user account names, not just with different prefs.
897|125177|2009-09-20 02:09:00|Yes, it's QTKit. This was a change for me since in Wii Transfer I mostly use ffmpeg. Threads are still an issue sometimes, though.
897|125178|2009-09-21 07:09:00|Thanks. :-) We should have another episode this week, I hope.

1887|125957|2009-09-23 13:42:24|Also, he has repeatedly sad adaption when he means adaptation. He doesn't know the difference.
1887|125958|2009-09-23 13:42:38|not that adaption is a word
1887|125959|2009-09-23 14:12:45|Education Major #1 won't stop talking long enough for me to blog about him. Aargh.
1887|125960|2009-09-23 14:31:30|oh god! i have SO MUCH to say about education majors! I'll have to start postdating blog posts soon. this is ridiculous.

1887|125962|2009-09-23 16:40:27|so. i've decided i better not post the blog here even though i'm really careful not to include any identifying info at all. i'm chicken.

1887|125965|2009-09-23 17:08:44|i'm seriously considering password-protecting the blog since so many people are already finding out about it.
1887|125966|2009-09-23 17:09:20|i hate education majors, but i don't want to crush their souls. i just want to make fun of them. is that so wrong?
1887|125967|2009-09-23 17:10:18|and it's not like i've made it clear *which* education majors i'm talking about, so only they'd know who i'm talking about.

1940|125992|2009-10-27 18:03:02|Thanks for feeling my pain. This is my third time moving and doing the Comcast CableCARD dance. I'm an expert in this pain.
1940|125993|2009-10-27 18:01:07|Comcast tech added new card to TiVo. Main office removed existing card (which worked) from account. Now I have two failing CableCARDs. Neat.
1940|125994|2009-10-27 15:37:07|For original HD TiVo, you definitely need two single-stream cards. Thanks, though.
1940|125995|2009-10-27 15:13:13|Twitter says you're not following me so can't DM.
1940|125996|2009-10-27 15:10:48|Argh! Comcast tech came with no single-stream cards. Again.  anybody? What else can I do? Seriously.
1940|125997|2009-10-26 19:02:03|Every contact point with Comcast install has been fraught with multiple failures, via web, phone or in person. Latest: Tech no-show today.

1940|126004|2009-10-23 20:28:37|Thanks, man. Good to know. So maybe the multi's only work on certain channels. Hrm. I've requested singles. We'll see...
1940|126005|2009-10-23 20:25:40|Yeah, I've requested single-streams for tomorrow install. Multi's seem to work OK. I just can't tune full channel lineup.
1940|126006|2009-10-23 20:22:02|I have first-edition TiVo HD. Needs two separate cards.
1940|126007|2009-10-23 20:04:37|Haha OK. The reply seemed canned. All's well. I have two CableCARDs. They are having trouble configuring. Happens every time
1940|126008|2009-10-23 20:03:06|Thanks, but tried the other day for a sign-up issue. No response. Good news is quick to help.
1940|126009|2009-10-23 20:00:54|I'm wondering if is a ro-bot.
1940|126010|2009-10-23 19:56:15|The cable guy was on the phone lots during the install. Couldn't seem to get anyone who knew how to set up and hit cards.
1940|126011|2009-10-23 19:45:46|Over two hours and no love from Comcast CableCARD install in TiVo HD. Anyone have any tips on getting the fast track to good tech support?

3840|127857|2009-11-05 16:54:17|are you and I the media when we're talking about current events outside of technology?
3840|127858|2009-11-05 16:53:15|If the 2/3 shooters at #FortHood are all recent converts to Islam, and did this for religious reasons, would this be a terrorist attack?
3840|127859|2009-11-05 16:50:52|Is it wrong for people to speculate about motives of shooter(s) in Fort Hood shooting as it's happening? other breaking news? M$5
3840|127860|2009-11-05 16:49:32|Well, I'm torn on speculation. Twitter is chatter & is it wrong for intelligent people to react to facts as they are breaking?
3840|127861|2009-11-05 16:48:28|scary if it is not an individual thing, but more like a terrorism thing. reports are saying 2-3 shooters. all unconfirmed i guess
3840|127862|2009-11-05 16:47:25|another user made a #forthood shooting page. Interested to see how these are updated vs CNN http://www.mahalo.com/fort-hood-shooting #mahalo
3840|127863|2009-11-05 16:46:14|a user started a page on #forthood shooter Malik Nadal Hasan (ads will be turned off in a moment) http://www.mahalo.com/malik-nadal-hasan
3840|127864|2009-11-05 16:44:29|well, it's a breaking story, so the facts will be suspect for a days.... twitter is just folks sitting around teh tv talking.
3840|127865|2009-11-05 16:42:02|you are correct. Twitter + the unthinkable makes your mind naturally wonder. someone told me shooter was recent convert to islam
3840|127866|2009-11-05 16:41:09|Really?! whoa, that's scary? anyone else confirm? r/t main shooter was from Virginia and was a recent convert to Islam.
3840|127867|2009-11-05 16:34:43|Too soon to know, but I wonder/fear this is what happens when you push soldiers to the limit in a war that they can't win.
3840|127868|2009-11-05 16:30:35|Or sadly, the film Stop Loss gave a look into what these poor soliders deal with.... less like Hurt Locker. sad they couldn't help #forthood
3840|127869|2009-11-05 16:27:08|Very sad to hear what happened at Fort Hood. Was this 1 solider or multiple? Wonder if this is burnout? Thinking about The Hurt Locker.

4999|128858|2009-09-18 14:09:00|My advice? Stop reading any blog post that says I dont know the full backstory, but. If you don't know, then STFU.
4999|128859|2009-09-18 14:09:00|It's cute that 37 Signals sees generational fights in the everyday machinations of capitalism. Cute like an idealistic teenager.
4999|128860|2009-09-18 14:09:00|I am getting old. But the web does not have generations. It it one, ever-flowing stream, and we're all in it.
4999|128861|2009-09-18 14:09:00|Exactly!
4999|128862|2009-09-18 14:09:00|If you see everything as a generational battle, you should probably talk to a therapist about your mommy/daddy issues. Just saying.
4999|128863|2009-09-18 15:09:00|Of course, I think everything is a reason to get more therapy. It's always worked for me.
4999|128864|2009-09-18 20:09:00|Okay, Rush. We GET it. You're a racist. Moving on.
4999|128865|2009-11-09 19:05:29|Australians always ask where we're from, and for the first time in a long time, I'm not embarrassed to say.

4999|128875|2009-11-06 19:49:59|Goodbye, Perth. Thanks for a great time.
4999|128876|2009-11-06 19:49:15|Thanks! I know they recorded audio. Not sure what they'll do with it.

5091|128904|2009-11-09 13:27:37|Oh man I'm the wrong person to ask for non-web stuff. But SXSW ALWAYS has some top-notch design talks/panels.
5091|128905|2009-11-09 10:33:41|Less often as of late. But I've been to enough. AEA was by far the worst unless you're a beginner or corporate HTML jockey.
5091|128906|2009-11-09 10:08:53|Focused and accessible. Those two do not have to be mutually exclusive.
5091|128907|2009-11-09 10:03:15|No! It's a complete waste of a conference. Unless you really want to learn about HTML/CSS or designing blog layouts.
5091|128908|2009-11-09 00:24:47|Amazon has them in sale for $100 right now. Might be a good time to pick one up and then return it if you're other one gets fix
5091|128909|2009-11-08 22:53:40|Agreed. It's very sad and can be very disheartening.
5091|128910|2009-11-08 21:57:03|I have both but I think I'll be buying it on xbox as most of the guys I know play on live :(
5091|128911|2009-11-08 20:05:47|On PS or XBox?
5091|128912|2009-11-08 19:39:23|A lot of my wife's family works at that church. That guy (Driscoll) is garbage. Amazing talent at manipulating people with lies.
5091|128913|2009-11-08 16:42:27|Using an HD instead of a SSD in that enviornment seems really odd to me.

5091|128927|2009-10-31 14:22:46|you're such a tease. And I'm jealous of Batman and all his insider knowledge!
5091|128928|2009-10-29 20:31:00|Okay I'll give you that, but not enough to sue him methinks. I've always enjoyed OC's previous projects like Port Blue.
5091|128929|2009-10-29 16:49:36|Because The (ex) Postal Service has a patent on using a synth? :/
5091|128930|2009-10-29 16:27:24|Is that for xbox or ps? Where can I get it?
5091|128931|2009-10-28 12:34:42|Just a really cheap rangefinder, Yashica GSN http://drp.ly/1uo3r. BUt it's got a really cool Aperture priority mode, which is fun.
5091|128932|2009-10-28 01:06:09|Yes! Would be crazy fun. Just got a new cam to I wanna shoot around with.

5374|129140|2009-12-01 14:21:17|I would like to lose (about 10lbs) one dress size, or an inch or two off my waist, but not based on weight.

5374|129150|2009-12-01 11:26:24|I printed 30 pages of bullshit.
5374|129151|2009-12-01 11:18:08|I am so sorry, earth.
5374|129152|2009-12-01 11:16:06|HOW DO YOU CANCEL A PRINTER
5374|129153|2009-12-01 10:30:21|I feel like that too. I feel like it's inappropriate! But says it's important to always protect your eyes.
5374|129154|2009-12-01 09:43:21|Nicely done! You're off and running :-)
5374|129155|2009-12-01 09:42:50|Cool, right? From text just say d culvers Then add your message behind it. :-)
5374|129156|2009-12-01 09:38:31|We're so sorry about mixing up your order and would like to make it right. Can you give your e-mail so we can talk?
5374|129157|2009-12-01 09:37:22|They said to dm them your email address so they can talk to you!
5374|129158|2009-12-01 09:35:01|Hey Kim, that's so awesome that is going to take care of you after your mixup yesterday!
5374|129159|2009-12-01 08:41:56|There is no good way to do that unless they bring it up first, ESPECIALLY if it's a woman. Tread lightly.
5374|129160|2009-12-01 08:39:29|Ooh, you know, I heard them on last.fm and forgot to check them out further. Thanks for the rec!
5374|129161|2009-12-01 08:31:22|Definite guilty pleasure. I know it's not high caliber stuff but I could run to it for sure!
5374|129162|2009-12-01 08:23:40|Cobra Starship, Army of Freshmen, Von Bondies. Why didn't anyone tell me about this deliciously irresistible music before?
5374|129163|2009-12-01 08:09:33|No, it was more important to me to tweet the event than to actually get the DS. haha
5374|129164|2009-12-01 08:06:27|Had a dream that we were camping and we hiked out of the woods for an hour to buy the new DS and there was a riot and I was Twitpic'ing it.
5374|129165|2009-12-01 07:46:14|I dreamed last night that we were somehow related, and you were at my family reunion!
5374|129166|2009-12-01 07:44:47|That's completely freezing!!
5374|129167|2009-12-01 07:39:31|I've done worse. That's all I'm saying. :-)

5374|129181|2009-09-19 13:09:00|Would you rather be called sugar or babycakes? Trick question!!!!
5374|129182|2009-09-19 13:09:00|Oh great I have to play the part of the moronic idiot who doesn't know how to work the parking meter thingie (kiosk?).

5374|129188|2009-09-19 15:09:00|Pro Tip: Bring some stuff into the dressing room that you KNOW won't fit. That way, less guilt when you buy everything else.

5374|129190|2009-09-19 15:09:00|What to do, no coupons! Someone come to the Grand and save me!
5374|129191|2009-09-19 15:09:00|I asked nicely and my associate, Gayle, gave me her extra Goodwill coupons! Goodwill Good Samaritan.
5374|129192|2009-09-19 15:09:00|Boston Store. You get a 20% off coupon for every item you donate!

8291|130439|2009-11-08 17:04:56|avoid mature pea stalks, and go for young pea vines. if not farmers market, chinese veggie markets. ask 4 doh miao in mandarin
8291|130440|2009-11-08 16:55:34|quick trip to the wok with garlic, sea salt (or any yummy salt) a tiny tiny bit of oil is standard. try w/ mandarins+pine nut 2
8291|130441|2009-11-08 16:43:36|can you get snap pea vines at your farmers market? best part of the plant is the young vines, not the peas.
8291|130442|2009-11-08 16:42:23|holy crap! one days notice for tokyo? hope it's for something AWESOME. have fun!
8291|130443|2009-11-08 15:46:17|related: DAMN you make canceling orders placed mere minutes ago VERY hard. do i have to wait until it ships then return it?
8291|130444|2009-11-08 15:44:29|tried to be rational. ordered new mac mini. instantly regretted it. getting old imac repaired to tide me over til i know what i really want.

8291|130448|2009-11-08 13:32:20|you don't need to figure that out, the G1 will figure it out for you and update over the air if need be.
8291|130449|2009-11-08 11:19:09|glad a self-admitted fan boy can appreciate some other stuff. almost not fair to call g1 1st gen since it's had 4 soft updates

8291|130456|2009-11-07 17:09:33|did you see 's response about jojos? i rest my case. no one outside pdx knows WTH they are.
8291|130457|2009-11-07 17:08:02|so glad to hear it. we'll need to go there next time i hit new york.
8291|130458|2009-11-07 17:04:27|maybe that's because closing an app is an arcane concept only nokias (and winmo) still have.
8291|130459|2009-11-07 17:02:44|all i use that mac for is front row, hulu + itunes 27 monster might be overkill. thinking new mini + big display

8291|130461|2009-11-07 14:32:02|answer is categorically no. JoJos are unique to 75mi radius of Portland. cease to exist btwn salem & corvallis.
8291|130462|2009-11-06 19:52:43|you and can't bully me like you did i'll fix my 24 for half the price of buying a 27. 1080p is enough
8291|130463|2009-11-06 19:36:56|my 24 iMac died. do i pay $700 to repair it or pay the same price for a new mini (but then i would have to buy a tv/monitor too)?

8291|130466|2009-11-06 10:48:40|i've been researching TMO too. you can get a sim only more everything plan. you just pay 6 bucks and bring your own phone.

10202|131065|2009-11-16 22:01:59|Ooooh. Look at 's blog in Thesis - http://bit.ly/12wDxN
10202|131066|2009-11-16 22:01:35|- great question. The team.
10202|131067|2009-11-16 22:01:06|- There are themes that are free. Thesis is not. It's a premium theme. themes.wordpress.net has many free ones.
10202|131068|2009-11-16 22:00:16|- technically, me too. But in the short term, I don't care.
10202|131069|2009-11-16 22:00:07|- and I have tons of design friends to share.
10202|131070|2009-11-16 21:46:53|- but if you want it to look custom, I'd say you want design themes.
10202|131071|2009-11-16 21:46:40|- it looks good out of the box, and if you watch the video embedded in the post I linked to, you'll see some new design tips.
10202|131072|2009-11-16 21:42:57|Always happy to see new designs based on Thesis. Looking for a quality WordPress theme? -  http://bit.ly/1k9SXg
10202|131073|2009-11-16 21:41:19|- I'm really happy about that. I love Thesis. I think has a great Wordpress Theme.
10202|131074|2009-11-16 21:40:55|- it's an oldie so doesn't talk about social media as much.
10202|131075|2009-11-16 21:37:18|- I do. We don't exactly have finger rolls together, but I've met him a bunch of times.

10202|131082|2009-12-04 16:34:23|- interesting and odd.
10202|131083|2009-12-04 16:33:21|- yipes. I can't imagine.
10202|131084|2009-12-04 16:20:29|- funny, I was thinking something similar.
10202|131085|2009-12-04 16:14:00|Just heard at my ice cream store: we don't have cones. They're coming in later. Um....
10202|131086|2009-12-04 16:09:39|- if had his way, GateJumpers would have been our next book. I stole the topic for something new. : )
10202|131087|2009-12-04 16:09:12|- should, but doesn't. API-related problems.

10202|131089|2009-12-04 16:08:16|Hello world!
10202|131090|2009-12-04 16:00:06|- I think it's been an interesting exercise so far.
10202|131091|2009-12-04 15:52:17|- thanks. : )
10202|131092|2009-12-04 15:49:05|- thanks. That's in my no-fly-zone, so probably won't be available, but if that changes, I'll ping you. : )

10202|131094|2009-12-04 15:45:39|- mostly because I like but also, in the early days, it let me make lists by adding instead of trying to load things.
10202|131095|2009-12-04 15:45:14|- sorry and congrats. A gift for you - http://bit.ly/2le6qB
10202|131096|2009-12-04 15:40:48|- that's just it. That's the issue, really. So far, my little town is little. I wouldn't want it getting microscopic.
10202|131097|2009-12-04 15:40:19|And no, , I didn't try a backflip. I tried the Chevy Chase dance in Christmas Vacation.
10202|131098|2009-12-04 15:39:40|- beats me. I think it was just one dude.
10202|131099|2009-12-04 15:38:35|- not even close. But then, I change it.
10202|131100|2009-12-04 15:35:45|- right. That's how I prove I'm not famous.

10202|131102|2009-12-04 15:32:29|Technically, not a feeling of celebrity. More like.. oh crap, do I need to move my office?
10202|131103|2009-12-04 15:31:57|- I *love* Cider Hill Farm. I take the kids there.
10202|131104|2009-12-04 15:31:03|- I said, I might be. Do I owe you money, or was I inappropriate?
10202|131105|2009-12-04 15:30:29|- better than a Storm. Not sure about Tour or Storm 2.
10202|131106|2009-12-04 15:29:00|- meh. What do I know? Everyone has their own take.
10202|131107|2009-12-04 15:28:50|- see if you can bid.
10202|131108|2009-12-04 15:28:42|- pity. I like being funny. : )
10202|131109|2009-12-04 15:28:32|- I still like line  massive multiplayer online photoshop.
10202|131110|2009-12-04 15:28:18|- agreed. I think pooping on it is the bad move.
10202|131111|2009-12-04 15:27:43|Just got are you Chris Brogan? at my local coffeeshop. Now that's rare. : )
10202|131112|2009-12-04 15:26:58|- will be on the blog tomorrow. : )
10202|131113|2009-12-04 15:26:35|- I don't seem to talk on Twitter about funny things, I guess.
10202|131114|2009-12-04 15:26:22|- my take - http://bit.ly/5k5wpr
10202|131115|2009-12-04 15:26:12|- that paper stuff helps.
10202|131116|2009-12-04 15:25:56|- I remember, but you're right.
10202|131117|2009-12-04 15:25:43|- Evernote/Pixelpipe/Snaptell/Twidroid/and Maps.
10202|131118|2009-12-04 15:25:18|- things I want in the doing business department. Project requests, etc.
10202|131119|2009-12-04 15:24:56|- I don't think Droid is it, but I think it's close. My take - http://bit.ly/5k5wpr
10202|131120|2009-12-04 15:24:39|- beats me. People often say I didn't realize you were funny when they meet me in person. Odd, eh?
10202|131121|2009-12-04 15:24:09|- the Droid thing? Yeah. Silly, eh?
10202|131122|2009-12-04 15:13:47|I'm going to put together a business wish list for 2010. Why not?
10202|131123|2009-12-04 15:13:36|- very cool, Toby!
10202|131124|2009-12-04 15:12:39|- true. What was missing: web-to-real integration.
10202|131125|2009-12-04 15:12:28|- I don't have stats on that.
10202|131126|2009-12-04 15:12:13|Oooh. Droid ad pooping on iPhone - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLDxv9ohH2s (youtube)
10202|131127|2009-12-04 15:06:20|- oh, all I'm doing is collecting fringe blogs and books about education for adults. Learning some new models.
10202|131128|2009-12-04 15:02:26|- that's my plan. : )
10202|131129|2009-12-04 15:02:15|- makes sense
10202|131130|2009-12-04 15:02:00|- huge. They'll push hard about monopoly so it'll take a while.
10202|131131|2009-12-04 15:01:33|- was it ever alive?
10202|131132|2009-12-04 14:54:24|- I used ScreenFlow for mac
10202|131133|2009-12-04 14:53:58|- no, the brogan OR chrisbrogan column finds stuff that the Replies column misses (typos and stuff).

10202|131179|2009-12-06 15:04:21|- collaboration is often a mess because no one leads, and because no one keeps a guiding measure. #newbooks.

10202|131185|2009-12-06 14:38:46|- re the author/reader comment earlier, I try hard to think of them as participants/collaborators.
10202|131186|2009-12-06 14:37:08|In my newsletter, I talked about drawing business. Here's a brief example (video) -  http://bit.ly/5st2Bx
10202|131187|2009-12-06 14:17:32|- we provide anonymized data and references.
10202|131188|2009-12-06 14:07:09|- then I doubt you've worked in consulting. I put my client list on my site. You can ask any of them for details.
10202|131189|2009-12-06 13:52:46|- what? That old thing? Hardly remembered. ;)
10202|131190|2009-12-06 13:50:51|- what would be unfortunate would be betraying my clients' trust. I might solicit so case studies.
10202|131191|2009-12-06 13:42:42|- always good to measure. I didn't include everything. Just a sampler.
10202|131192|2009-12-06 13:41:42|- I prefer making revenue improve.
10202|131193|2009-12-06 13:40:51|- not in most cases. Their engagements are private and theirs to expose.
10202|131194|2009-12-06 13:30:01|- my answer would be # of engagements per student. Seeking average of 4-7 or something per month.
10202|131195|2009-12-06 13:29:43|- best person to answer that is , and maybe . They have direct experience.

10202|131207|2009-09-19 08:09:00|- mmmm
10202|131208|2009-09-19 08:09:00|- good one.

10202|131214|2009-09-19 08:09:00|- hmmm. You could. Depends how passionate you are. Looking around isn't bad, but you can do your own game. :)
10202|131215|2009-09-19 08:09:00|- I neither dance nor walk in the woods (love the woods). I make a map and I set sail.

10202|131217|2009-09-19 08:09:00|- killer. How are you?
10202|131218|2009-09-19 08:09:00|- fair. :)

10350|131777|2009-12-01 00:17:15|well, that changes everything, because I totally had composite cables to lend you!

10350|131784|2009-11-30 15:00:17|It's kind of weird when people invite you to their wedding on Facebook. When you don't know them.

10350|131789|2009-11-29 18:31:44|The one USB cable (male A to A) I need is the one we somehow don't have in a house filled with cables. What the cuss.

10508|132148|2009-10-30 20:39:12|I used 9 deep dish tins. Next time I'll try my Pampered Chef stoneware pie plates... they look bigger...

10508|132155|2009-10-30 15:02:09|That was kind of my suspicion. We were using a different method, too, but couldn't afford to make that point in court.
10508|132156|2009-10-30 12:24:37|I read a book (There's No Place Like Here) that was all about the place where missing socks (and memories, and people) go.

10990|132317|2009-11-13 15:11:14|The FDA threatened on Friday to ban caffeinated alcoholic drinks. They mean the prepackaged ones. Jack and Cokes are still safe!
10990|132318|2009-11-12 18:27:42|Minna gets so worked up when she cries she gets all sweaty. She looked like, well, someone who gets really sweaty, like Kevin Garnett.

10990|132321|2009-11-12 13:20:07|Argh! Ready to do my new DVD workout and now I can't find my weights anyplace!
10990|132322|2009-11-11 20:11:12|A mention of Geo Benson, I'm transported back to a summer my cousin and I played 1 of his records so much my g-ma took it away and hid it.
10990|132323|2009-11-11 16:34:11|oh no, way stranger. Like, I can get any man I want and he'll take care of me... then do that! kind of break up. So awkward!
10990|132324|2009-11-11 16:24:58|exactly!

10990|132329|2009-11-10 16:37:03|Eyes been bothering me so switched from contacts to glasses yesterday. Now hurts too much on sides of head for glasses. Tomorrow = blurry.
10990|132330|2009-11-10 12:55:04|Ollie got a haircut and looks totally different.
10990|132331|2009-11-08 20:35:30|Minna was goofing around while nursing. I told her to log on! That is what La Leche League calls it, right?
10990|132332|2009-11-08 15:14:43|Sure wish I were watching the last 30 sec of Pats game instead of these commercials. FU NFL and your contractual obligations.
10990|132333|2009-11-08 13:43:37|Made ginger cookies with Ollie today. He's a really good sous baker!
10990|132334|2009-11-08 10:23:13|Whatever music Jason's put on the stereo is stressing me out. It's that highly anxious sort of instrumental.

10990|132340|2009-11-06 02:24:06|OK and I watched our first Bert and Ernie the other day. After, I asked him what we'd watched. He said Bernie and Susan! Close.
10990|132341|2009-11-06 02:20:31|Weird I'm pretty sure I read it in NY Times. You'd think they'd fact check something like that!
10990|132342|2009-11-05 20:28:00|Tried a new way to style my hair (by which I mean I combed before wrapping in towel rather than just towel). It failed, v bad hair day.

10990|132348|2009-11-04 22:02:33|Let's be clearer: RI, you're probably out of the gang too, you just haven't made your bias explicit like ME. Yet. When you do, you're out!
10990|132349|2009-11-04 21:59:09|Just said this to another RIer: I didn't. It's just that joke didn't work for RI bc haven't leg. gay marriage yet nor banned.

10990|132356|2009-11-27 08:50:06|Black Friday idea cont'd: some ppl get 10% off, some 50% a few 90%. Then less of a crush for few items, still bargains for all.
10990|132357|2009-11-27 08:47:42|Black Friday idea: instead of a few items v cheap, why not all items at random unknown price? Never over $x but you'd know price at checkout
10990|132358|2009-11-27 05:41:29|I'm thankful for sleep! Minna slept from 7:45p until 5:50a. In her clothes too bc we figured it was a nap, not really asleep for night.

10990|132361|2009-11-26 04:25:45|oh gosh yes, make and stuff right before goes into oven!
10990|132362|2009-11-25 21:01:48|a few folks say cold mostly bc warm/hot will accelerate bacteria growth. Your thoughts?
10990|132363|2009-11-25 19:31:13|why? Bc warm stuffing causes bacteria to grow quickly? but it's killed when reaches 165, and will get to 165 faster warm, no?
10990|132364|2009-11-25 19:19:37|Argument against stuffing is takes so long for stuffing to reach 165 that bird is overdone. So if you start hot, wouldn't it take less time?
10990|132365|2009-11-25 19:11:02|Say you're committed to stuffing your turkey. Should you stuff with hot, warm, or cold stuffing?
10990|132366|2009-11-25 16:16:56|Apple pie accomplished and delegated pumpkin so my Tday work, at least for today, is done! Contemplating cinn rolls for bfast tomorrow.

12435|133752|2009-09-18 19:05:56|As I stand here attempting to take a shower in the sink of this Walmart bathroom, I am reminded of why I'm not a fan of camping.
12435|133753|2009-09-17 16:48:20|Ugh. I'm halfway through this book on using Twitter for marketing and I _still_ can't get our campfire started.
12435|133754|2009-09-16 11:36:51|We greet other people at the campsite by picking a random thing and saying a little bit of it never hurt anybody. It's like a secret code.

12449|133833|2009-10-20 21:13:59|agreed!! responded to about it, but I dunno what Simon is trying to say...
12449|133834|2009-10-20 19:07:56|and the GPL precludes third-parties from having anywhere near the rights of the copyright holder (e.g private mods for sale)
12449|133835|2009-10-20 19:04:35|but with an Apache license, the copyright holder and third-parties have near-equal rights to set commercial terms

12514|133892|2009-09-13 19:09:00|Quick question to Apple MacBook owners - particularly designers - do you have a glossy screen on your laptop? Is it okay? Is the glare okay?

12514|133894|2009-09-13 20:09:00|Hm. The anti-glare screens are available in the Apple Store but they really do look like they were designed as an afterthought. Hmm.
12514|133895|2009-09-13 20:09:00|Hm. Thanks for the insight! You don't have any design or colour calibration issues?

12514|133941|2009-11-10 02:32:56|Watching the finale of Mad Men and getting sort of itchy.
12514|133942|2009-11-09 23:07:44|Phew! Work day over. Now for tacos.
12514|133943|2009-11-09 21:19:48|Twitter's using Yahoo WOE ids for their geocoding, making them compatible with Fire Eagle, Flickr, GeoPlanet etc. http://bit.ly/BdEmB
12514|133944|2009-11-09 18:40:58|About halfway through my first day back in the office after my vacation and starting to feel like I might be able to catch up. Maybe.
12514|133945|2009-11-09 17:33:59|Nnngh. Profoundly aggravating inability to get on VPN from the wifi at work, meaning that today's meetings are totally impractical.
12514|133946|2009-11-09 14:13:32|That was my conclusion too. Really quite simple if you know the trick :)
12514|133947|2009-11-09 13:36:04|Thinking about starting an industry trolls Twitter list. They should add in Block this list functionality.
12514|133948|2009-11-09 03:25:08|Really lovely to be home. Had brief visit from and Now must try and sleep even though not really tired.
12514|133949|2009-11-09 00:40:43|I'm really excited about the Twitter / Geolocation thing. It's the kind of thing Fire Eagle was supposed to enable internet-wide.
12514|133950|2009-11-09 00:03:51|Cab driver literally listening to I believe children are the future...
12514|133951|2009-11-28 15:33:44|Wow, this new Fuck Buttons album is pretty amazing.
12514|133952|2009-11-28 11:47:01|Dammit. Ninja Assassin gets 38 on Metacritic?! I really wanted that to be awesome. http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/ninjaassassin
12514|133953|2009-11-28 02:42:35|Loving description of today as Thanksboxing Day.
12514|133954|2009-11-28 00:39:29|I love my little brother. He's so awesome. He writes really entertaining things on Twitter.
12514|133955|2009-11-28 00:09:10|Watching a video about how they assembled the team for Mad Men and wondering if I should do a talk about that stuff at some point.
12514|133956|2009-11-27 23:59:26|God, it is so nice after a couple of days of indulgence and friends and eating to still have a full weekend of relaxation ahead of me.
12514|133957|2009-11-27 12:49:34|Angry with myself for a whole range of reasons that are too complicated to go into.
12514|133958|2009-11-27 00:59:17|Worn out.
12514|133959|2009-11-26 16:01:02|The turducken looks great, the steamed treacle puds are ready to be steamed, now just waiting for it all to be cooked.
12514|133960|2009-11-26 10:39:00|There is no job that LCD Soundsystem's 45:33 can't help with.
12514|133961|2009-11-26 10:15:02|Trying to find my darkness, corner it, kill it, skin it and eat it before I spend time with lovely people for Thanksgiving.
12514|133962|2009-11-26 00:21:56|I love my friends and I hate my brain.
12514|133963|2009-11-25 20:33:51|That's the one. Honestly, if you had it, you'd like it. Quite sweet though.
12514|133964|2009-11-25 18:43:55|Stopping work early today so I can go home and prepare some stuff for tomorrow. Have sieves, steamable things, need to check ingredients.
12514|133965|2009-11-25 17:25:17|God I hate the way that man self-promotes. It's the most lizard-like behaviour I've ever seen. You must not link to him!
12514|133966|2009-11-25 15:33:22|Bumholes. Where are my pudding bowls! Am I going to have to go and buy some at Williams Sonoma?! #firstworldproblems
12514|133967|2009-11-25 13:28:43|Does seem like pmwiki is pretty simple to set up and get going with. Already got it working and now looking into styling / options.
12514|133968|2009-11-25 13:04:48|Lots of people pro-pmwiki out there. Anyone got a counter-opinion?

12514|133974|2009-11-24 21:27:27|The blog is definitely not dead, although it's clearly unwell.
12514|133975|2009-11-24 21:26:49|This guy online wants like $3.5k for a domain I'd quite like but don't really need. Not going to happen.
12514|133976|2009-11-24 21:21:19|So far eleven people say change, eight say stay as it is, two don't appear to care.
12514|133977|2009-11-24 21:01:24|It's difficult to say for certain, but certainly that's my intention.
12514|133978|2009-11-24 20:47:29|Hm. This is generating more debate than I thought it would.
12514|133979|2009-11-24 20:45:18|I care a lot for that, but whether I care enough to continue with another user name forever is unclear to me...
12514|133980|2009-11-24 20:29:10|Right then, people of the internets - should I change my Twitter user name to from Saves three chars.

12514|133982|2009-11-24 17:20:16|I'm not sure I'm supposed to be following people to make them feel better, am I?
12514|133983|2009-11-24 17:19:09|Webstock were great with me, but if they hadn't been so supportive, then my medium good talk could have been a catastrophe.
12514|133984|2009-11-24 17:17:10|I think conference organisers need to keep in mind that their job is to help the speakers convey their message at all costs.
12514|133985|2009-11-24 17:16:39|I did a talk at Webstock earlier this year that went fine, but I was still unhappy about and it keeps me up at night.
12514|133986|2009-11-24 17:14:56|How come?! I follow 380 people, but mainly because I know or care about what they're doing. Is that so wrong?
12514|133987|2009-11-24 16:41:26|My talks, for example, seem on the whole to go down pretty well with people, but without notes / slides, I'd not do them.
12514|133988|2009-11-24 16:40:49|If we limit public speaking to people who can riff epic speeches off the top of their heads, then we'll lose a lot of voices.
12514|133989|2009-11-24 16:39:49|That's great, but surely the aspiration is that very good thinkers are supported in giving good talks, by any means necessary.
12514|133990|2009-11-24 16:32:47|I have so much respect to for writing that up. I get tense before talks and need props to survive. In her place I would combust.

12514|133994|2009-11-24 15:26:23|I already have CS3 generally for own purposes, so that's not a problem.
12514|133995|2009-11-24 14:42:19|If you could add me so I can send you a DM, that would be handy.
12514|133996|2009-11-24 14:26:47|Dumb question. I have some Google Wave invitations if anyone wants one. Say yes on Twitter, I'll add you, then you can DM me your e-mail.
12514|133997|2009-11-24 13:32:01|What would be the easiest way for someone to create a combination simple animation / screencast to explain a product?
12514|133998|2009-11-24 13:20:46|Yeah, I know. I didn't get plasticbag because I was trying to be consistent, but I probably should have got - stupid me.

12522|134011|2009-11-12 07:59:28|Just because I bought your product DOES NOT MEAN I'm part of your community.. You need to get this.
12522|134012|2009-11-12 07:55:21|No clue what happened to AH today. Sounds like it used my Mac's mic rather then my real mic. Hmmm...at least the music sounds great
12522|134013|2009-11-12 07:51:13|Sounds like an amazing way to start the morning. Hope it is a productive day.
12522|134014|2009-11-12 07:50:42|You are most welcome. I love sharing my passion for passionate people with others and fits that in a big way
12522|134015|2009-11-12 07:50:22|Maybe they aced coding but failed math? You know how schools are these days *grin*
12522|134016|2009-11-12 07:48:36|I didn't do the math, http://howlonghaveyoubeentweeting.com did

12522|134019|2009-11-12 06:07:51|The second cup is helping me catch up on some writing and thinking about what to play on Accident Hash this morning
12522|134020|2009-11-12 05:57:30|Do you mean what am I going to do with my next cup of coffee??

12522|134023|2009-11-12 05:49:43|Let me know when the interview is up. Curious to see how it came out.
12522|134024|2009-11-12 05:49:17|how is your Dad doing this morning?
12522|134025|2009-11-11 22:25:58|Rock on. Quite the deal. Fun Halloween portraits by the way. Looks like you guys had fun.
12522|134026|2009-11-11 22:23:27|Your last tweet I saw pointed to http://firstgiving.com/sm4sc  and that link gives a 404 for me. Latest one you sent me worked though
12522|134027|2009-11-11 22:20:25|That link you are sharing is not working
12522|134028|2009-11-11 22:19:47|I'll take what is behind door #2? Seems like an easy call there.

12522|134048|2009-11-21 21:09:53|Seeing a tweet from makes me think it is the perfect night for a glass of his scotch. Thanks again for sending over a bottle!
12522|134049|2009-11-21 21:07:22|What is now killing me is that I get the same screen when I try to get to the plugin screen. FTP here I come

12522|134066|2009-11-21 13:49:43|I just TRIED to explain why I'm laughing so hard at what is doing to the kids, but I couldn't fully explain.
12522|134067|2009-11-21 13:49:06|Been on the road all week so I haven't read anything anywhere. Gotcha. It has been fun to follow.
12522|134068|2009-11-21 13:46:27|What is Junior Eurovision? Assuming a talent show based on your tweets? #jesc
12522|134069|2009-11-21 13:43:59|Ok, you can't throw that out there and not ask the obvious question
12522|134070|2009-11-21 13:43:25|Isn't it a riot? I have no desire to see #NewMoon and I can't stop laughing
12522|134071|2009-11-21 13:37:24|HA HA HA I'm just sayin. If my brother tried to eat my girlfriend, I'd do more than shove him. #NewMoon

12522|134073|2009-11-21 13:33:02|Thanks for checking in, but I already took care of things
12522|134074|2009-11-21 13:22:20|The fact that is doing live commentary from #NewMoon today is cracking me up. Can't wait to follow along.
12522|134075|2009-11-21 13:13:48|Heck, I don't even listen to NPR very much. I counter the kids pop sugar addiction pretty good
12522|134076|2009-11-21 13:13:10|HA HA! Yes, they still listen to radio but most of the time it is their iPods
12522|134077|2009-11-21 13:10:00|My kids are listening to KISS 108? Where did I go wrong as a parent? *laugh*
12522|134078|2009-11-21 12:52:18|I really didn't think I could, but have been pleasantly surprised
12522|134079|2009-11-21 12:25:00|Just think 80's wannabe preppy and you'll look fine
12522|134080|2009-11-21 12:16:48|Hello world!
12522|134081|2009-11-21 12:16:36|Well it was actually a conversation with a bunch of women *grin*
12522|134082|2009-11-21 12:04:49|Very sad to hear for sure. Too many people lost.
12522|134083|2009-11-21 12:04:28|Ha ha! We had a LONG conversation about that in NYC this week actually.
12522|134084|2009-11-21 12:01:28|Nope I couldn't . Sports is something I watch a lot of and no real way around watching that on anything else.
12522|134085|2009-11-21 11:59:11|Ok time to dive in and finish my final #sonydads project which is overdue
12522|134086|2009-11-21 11:56:50|Depends on how many you need. The first few are free.
12522|134087|2009-11-21 11:55:45|Now THAT sounds like it would be a good puppet. The Jester.
12522|134088|2009-11-21 11:54:28|Thank you very much. Every dime helps so it is appreciated
12522|134089|2009-11-21 11:52:57|You usually are correct even though most people fail to see that.
12522|134090|2009-11-21 11:52:40|True. Very True. #Movember
12522|134091|2009-11-21 11:52:29|They sent me out a brochure in the mail and then the TVs went blank on most stations
12522|134092|2009-11-21 11:49:44|For sure, but even if people can't donate, it would be great to see everyone helping spread the message
12522|134093|2009-11-21 11:48:49|In case you didn't know. Every guy growing a mustache for #Movember is doing it to help raise money for cancer research
12522|134094|2009-11-21 11:46:53|I'm thinking a lot about that at the moment right now.
12522|134095|2009-11-21 11:45:23|And yet there are SO many faces in this case.  But, I know what you mean.
12522|134096|2009-11-21 11:44:47|Thank you VERY much for the #Movember donation
12522|134097|2009-11-21 11:41:46|I'm also disappointed that http://milliondollardrew.com isn't a screaming success yet. We should all be promoting this to help #beatcancer
12522|134098|2009-11-21 11:37:45|The link to donate to my #Movember efforts is http://www.helpingthecause.com
12522|134099|2009-11-21 11:34:46|Should I be bummed at how few of my friends have donated towards my #Movember efforts?
12522|134100|2009-11-21 11:27:19|That is awesome! always inspires me #NaNoDrawMo
12522|134101|2009-11-21 11:10:12|Just got a big smile seeing the update finally hit the app store
12522|134102|2009-11-21 10:53:28|Hope you are having fun in Nashville.  If you go to Loveless pick me up some BBQ Rub please. I'm all out.
12522|134103|2009-11-21 10:48:34|All this learning means nothing until you make something happen: http://sivers.org/confidence
12522|134104|2009-11-21 10:30:40| I never even thought of that! That must be in. Turns us all a little grumpier. Blame the MO!
12528|134105|2009-11-11 20:00:33|Props to Sittig for adding this place to Gowalla. â€ at Hotel Biron http://gowal.la/s/88F
12528|134106|2009-11-11 18:03:21|does this need to have some sort of Gowalla API functionality? ;)

12528|134115|2009-11-10 15:40:17|you're too kind. We're working hard to polish the rough edges. Definitely appreciate the feedback.

12528|134117|2009-11-10 15:18:33|so, are you holding onto your BB for religious reasons? (fwiw, we hope to have m.gowalla working on BB soon)
12528|134118|2009-11-10 14:50:38|we're going to add that soon.
12528|134119|2009-11-10 14:40:52|glad that you found it. Apple kinda buries that in there. Sounds like your friends need better coffeeshops. :-/

12528|134139|2009-11-08 15:28:29|I don't think either side is bi-partisan. That's why there are two parties. And MSNBC. And FOX. #irony

12543|134176|2009-11-08 23:23:12|sorry about annoying gowalla tweets. for what it's worth, we never auto-tweet anything -- the user has to opt-in each time.
12543|134177|2009-11-07 17:05:55|yo. you should check in on Gowalla before tonight's Mavs game: http://bit.ly/gowalla

12543|134179|2009-11-06 17:57:38|for my info, what's the spot? maybe it needs a location tweak.
12543|134180|2009-11-06 17:56:05|yeah, that's a drag. the next release (awaiting approval) handles low-accuracy checkins better, FWIW.
12543|134181|2009-11-06 16:29:11|you get more items as bonuses for checking in at certain spots -- e.g., coffee items tend to pop up at coffeeshops, etc.
12543|134182|2009-11-06 16:25:43|Android folks: we just released an experimental Gowalla webapp at http://m.gowalla.com -- check in, see where you friends are, etc.
12543|134183|2009-11-06 11:46:52|yes - the avatar is a custom illustration by one of the icon artists I work with.
12543|134184|2009-11-06 01:00:08|yes, m.gowalla.com works on iPhone and android -- would love webOS support.
12543|134185|2009-11-05 21:34:25|gowalla for webOS is on my TODO, but I'm not sure when exactly. it'd help if the pre browser supported W3C geolocation. :-(

12797|134634|2009-09-20 17:09:00|there was no offense intended. I was merely commenting and my tone didn't come across. I don't consider family work though.
12797|134635|2009-09-20 17:09:00|there is no need to assume I'm attacking you or your schedule. More obviously Im not dedicated enough to work weekends.

18713|136211|2009-11-11 22:45:01|The allure of low-level tools is as fleeting as that of high-level tools. Keep your wits about you in the land of jumps and call-graphs.
18713|136212|2009-11-11 22:42:39|It is raging and priapic.
18713|136213|2009-11-11 22:36:11|Happy to be going home, but not at all excited to be going back to San Francisco.
18713|136214|2009-11-11 02:20:01|Or, put another way: designing a language to counter Java's insane use of types is solving the wrong problem. Robust types can be done well.
18713|136215|2009-11-11 02:18:52|Looking at Go further, it seems the lightweight type system is its strength and weakness. A robust type system (with inference) is powerful.

18713|136217|2009-11-10 23:27:48|Well, there goes my A material. It's all fart jokes and topical humor from here on out.
18713|136218|2009-11-10 21:05:44|Nice to see people excited/talking about the new Go programming language. Gives me hope that we're not as jaded about languages as all that.

18713|136222|2009-11-10 04:36:31|Very high-concept cocktails at Zeta Bar. Their smoky martini is a martini served atop a glass of smoke, meant to be inhaled with each sip.
18713|136223|2009-11-10 03:26:10|The food at Spice Temple was, sadly, not a monument to spice, even though we saught out the spicy dishes. Also, I'm a bad person.
18713|136224|2009-11-10 00:39:11|Ended up at Red Oak a second time in as many days, embarassingly. Going to Spice Temple for dinner, then probably Zeta Bar.

18713|136230|2009-11-09 06:25:59|Absolutely fantastic meal at Quay. Sublime food, perfect service, and a view that most any restaurant would kill for. Worth it.
18713|136231|2009-11-08 23:06:42|Good Ol' Boys: they exist in every culture.
18713|136232|2009-11-08 23:01:00|At Red Oak, having a couple of totally solid beers. There's good microbrew in Oz afterall! Thanks to everyone who suggested the place.

18713|136237|2009-11-08 17:42:06|Heading to the aquarium and Wildlife World today. Got a reservation at Quay tonight. It's going to be another nice day in Sydney.
18713|136238|2009-11-08 17:40:36|Not yet, but it's on my list.
18713|136239|2009-11-08 01:32:57|Just home. Next trip!
18713|136240|2009-11-08 01:03:23|Sydney is a pretty city. A bit London, a bit California, mostly something all its own. Took in the MCA, interesting art scene. Humid here.
18713|136241|2009-11-08 01:00:43|Will do, thanks! It seems like what I've had of the local beer optimizes for a light, crisp character over body and flavor.
18713|136242|2009-11-08 00:47:36|Thanks for the suggestions! I was hoping to provoke some ;)
18713|136243|2009-11-08 00:32:13|Back at the hotel while does homework. Considering where to go for dinner, given that many restaurants in Sydney aren't open Sunday.
18713|136244|2009-11-08 00:29:05|Honestly, SF isn't really the best beer town in the US. Try Portland, Boulder, DC, etc.
18713|136245|2009-11-08 00:27:30|Any local advice would be much appreciated!
18713|136246|2009-11-07 23:51:36|That is why we are God's chosen country.
18713|136247|2009-11-07 23:51:07|I could get into it on that point, but I'll just say fair enough ;)
18713|136248|2009-11-07 23:18:21|At Lord Nelson's. Unless this country is hiding amazing microbrews somewhere, I'm beginning to think Australia is a bit behind on beer.
18713|136249|2009-11-07 19:18:44|First full day in Sydney. Late start. About to head to Surry Hill for brunch, then who knows what.

18713|136251|2009-11-07 03:51:49|Good evening, Sydney. Where would I find a superb cocktail near the CBD? Is Ember as good as the guides say?
18713|136252|2009-11-06 19:58:20|No, but Tim Berners-Lee did ;)
18713|136253|2009-11-06 19:08:02|Made some calls, now leaving Perth a day earlier. See you tonight, Sydney.
18713|136254|2009-11-06 01:35:22|By the water at Little Creatures. Great food, nice staff, lovely weather. Pity about the beer, but forgivable in such a nice setting.
18713|136255|2009-11-05 22:51:44|Just finished a four hour tutorial on the Twitter Platform. Voice is going to be shot for the rest of the day. Great group, though!

18713|136338|2009-11-29 16:16:33|Interesting. Most people who replied to me about that article disagreed with it (though less about the tooling stuff).
18713|136339|2009-11-29 16:09:35|Echofon does some nice stuff on both iPhone and Mac, but I'm back to Tweetie. There's no competing with good UX.
18713|136340|2009-11-29 15:02:27|I'm inclined to agree. I thought the quote was interesting, though, particularly given the source and context.
18713|136341|2009-11-29 14:49:14|That's probably the best response to that quote I've gotten so far.
18713|136342|2009-11-29 14:48:59|Yeah, I had pretty much the same reaction.
18713|136343|2009-11-29 14:31:20|Optimizations will get very, very sexy again, when people realize how we pay for abstractions.  http://bit.ly/5Cg0Ev

18713|136355|2009-11-28 14:17:49|I wish I had relationship problems that justified listening to The Raveonettes on loop. Gonna do it anyway.
18713|136356|2009-11-28 13:58:05|Scaldis Noel, St Fuellion Noel, Oud Beersel Framboise, Ichtegem Grand Cru, Gulden Draak. Two people, of course :)
18713|136357|2009-11-28 13:53:15|Weak sauce! Sauce that is weak! Not strong! Thin, watery, and weak! Thanks for looking into it, though. Next time!
18713|136358|2009-11-28 00:07:10|Becoming the Foursquare mayor of Dosa on Fillmore has not, as of yet, resulted in paneer kickbacks.
18713|136359|2009-11-27 20:34:03|NO I'M NOT GOING TO SEE NEW MOON AT 7PM AT THE KABUKI WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT
18713|136360|2009-11-27 20:32:09|I think the solution to the equation you're after is the picture of heterosexual masculinity.
18713|136361|2009-11-27 19:25:18|Now who's on the defensive, eh? What ho!
18713|136362|2009-11-27 19:23:34|Dude. Sharing is caring. Sounds awesome.
18713|136363|2009-11-27 18:21:23|HOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPSSSSSS
18713|136364|2009-11-27 18:20:32|Do you mind getting one for me and I'll get you back at the show tomorrow. Didn't realize they were playing two nights!
18713|136365|2009-11-27 17:59:06|Cool. We'll be by in a beer or so.
18713|136366|2009-11-27 17:55:20|Saw that. Looks fun.
18713|136367|2009-11-27 17:54:47|Tempting...
18713|136368|2009-11-27 17:54:07|Yeah! Where's your place and how long will you be home?
18713|136369|2009-11-27 17:36:03|Glad you have a hobby other than complaining about conservatives on your Tumblr now ;)
18713|136370|2009-11-27 17:34:50|At La Trappe in North Beach, having a couple of Belgian holiday beers. Join us! It's empty!
18713|136371|2009-11-27 17:13:23|Do you really think that campaign makes people feel involved?
18713|136372|2009-11-27 17:12:38|Yeah, probably not much, once the novelty factor wears off. It's an irrational position.
19223|136373|2009-11-08 03:09:58|Took me 3 weeks to get my cert...so a little over an hour sounds pretty good ;)
19223|136374|2009-11-08 01:30:08|Well that dog was very well behaved. It only barked once during the whole movie. Wait, what?
19223|136375|2009-11-07 21:58:28|Last I checked, abortion was legal.  Why can't a public insurance plan fund a legal procedure? Baffling. (via Nay, sickening.
19223|136376|2009-11-06 21:03:55|Anyone up for some NSDrinker tonight? others? eh? eh?

19223|136379|2009-11-05 13:03:25|Meh. 100% of banner ad viewers see the banner ad. Compare with commercials: you can't even click a commercial...only get name rec.
19223|136380|2009-11-05 00:15:18|You might want to set the release date to today so it gets on the recently released page. I think that is how it works...
19223|136381|2009-11-04 23:31:45|Hello world!
19223|136382|2009-11-04 21:32:19|YES.
19223|136383|2009-11-04 20:33:49|Do they have one for if you go forward in time? That one would be more useful.
19223|136384|2009-11-04 19:01:14|I think the changes take a bit for the desktop client though. The overall paid list is fixed, but Music is still messed up for me
19223|136385|2009-11-04 17:52:24|It seems that it's fixed on the iPhone App Store but not iTunes. Now we just have to wait for their fix to propagate...
19223|136386|2009-11-04 17:43:10|You referring to the App Store, right? It better get fixed soon...and restored to where it was...
19223|136387|2009-11-04 17:35:47|The Top Paid list in the Music category on the App Store is FUBAR. Like, super fucked up.
19223|136388|2009-11-04 14:08:48|No, the album versions as opposed to just live. I discovered iTunes just didn't download 3 songs from the album...
19223|136389|2009-11-04 14:01:35|I actually have SmartSleep installed so that file is only saved in dire circumstances. The problem is it is never deleted...
19223|136390|2009-11-04 13:59:43|About to hear the actual recording of a couple songs of The Hazards of Love for the first time...sqeeeee!
19223|136391|2009-11-04 13:53:38|How you know you need a new hard drive: 'sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage' is your most often typed command.
19223|136392|2009-11-04 11:45:31|I like Routesy for muni info.
19223|136393|2009-11-02 18:24:26|Yes...but for me that's better than the fucking history sheet popping up each time.
19223|136394|2009-11-02 18:10:59|For those of you as OCD as me: type about:blank into Safari and make a Home Screen bookmark of it called Safari. Replace Safari in dock.
19223|136395|2009-11-02 11:10:39|Good morning jackhammer!
19223|136396|2009-11-02 11:07:34|I attempted to solve this by making my desktop icons incredibly huge. It kinda worked for a while...

19223|136399|2009-10-29 23:03:28|I still haven't been to LimÃƒne. And it's right across the street.
19223|136400|2009-10-28 20:58:19|Is anyone leaving for the tech talks tomorrow from San Francisco who wants to car pool at 11am. Shot in the dark...
19223|136401|2009-10-28 16:43:00|Automator's Service template to the rescue!

19223|136404|2009-10-26 12:21:53|It should be called ArsWhole so you get the triple pun in there.

19223|136406|2009-10-25 12:57:02|NASAPP would have been so much better.
19223|136407|2009-10-25 01:53:16|DID THIS HAPPEN TO YOU TOO? http://digg.com/d3185pA

19443|136412|2009-11-25 02:13:31|music video maybe?
19443|136413|2009-11-25 02:10:29|not a bad idea, atleast when something happens there is proof that we should have told the authorities and didn't :)
19443|136414|2009-11-25 02:08:29|Off topic, sorry about this but I thought it was WAY to funny not to post: http://bit.ly/7jAXK0 #selfserving
19443|136415|2009-11-25 02:03:21|maybe it should be the official ringtone of the #phxdrama club :)
19443|136416|2009-11-25 01:58:49|if he does...PLEASE let me know, I will cancel everything to drive and and listen to it go go
19443|136417|2009-11-25 01:53:27|once again...that was AWESOME! #sunnycansavephoenixallbyhimself
19443|136418|2009-11-25 01:49:13|something like that...its called community, btw did you listen to this yet: http://bit.ly/6l3AB2 - thats called feedback :)
19443|136419|2009-11-25 01:47:34|Want to know what's really wrong?  Your paying to much for your car insurance :)
19443|136420|2009-11-25 01:34:08|James T. Kirk,  Jesse James, James Dean, James Gandolfini, James Earl Ray, which james?  :)
19443|136421|2009-11-25 01:32:06|I don't get it either, one comment made (mostly reflective) and then WHAMMO, I get this http://bit.ly/5FadE0
19443|136422|2009-11-25 01:29:55|anything I can do for the community :)
19443|136423|2009-11-25 01:24:04|your part of the problem :)  while not the most up to date, still my favorite of all the groups in town: http://bit.ly/65FFWV
19443|136424|2009-11-25 01:21:53|I guess only recently moving to PHX makes me wonder what all the in-fighting is about. weather's just getting nice. #phxdrama
19443|136425|2009-11-25 01:13:48|http://bit.ly/7pONwM - Seriously listen to this and tell me that this guy does not need therapy?  Anger management issues, wow
19443|136426|2009-11-25 01:12:13|I realize that...I never connected the two, I was at the first RadiatePHX back when it was called ignitephx.....
19443|136427|2009-11-25 01:11:19|but its a conversation that everyone is having, every group, every business, etc....its a topic that is getting OLD quick.
19443|136428|2009-11-25 01:06:16|yep, third paragraph...
19443|136429|2009-11-25 01:05:15|alright...while that was a good distraction, its time to get back to homework, client work and more.  All self serving I know #phxdrama
19443|136430|2009-11-25 01:03:26|I'm on it #phxdrama
19443|136431|2009-11-25 01:03:03|who thinks that?
19443|136432|2009-11-25 01:02:14|no worries, good to see you to next time I'll skip class because I am sure it will be worth it :)
19443|136433|2009-11-25 00:56:50|tonights lesson: don't tweet if you don't talk, even if the conversation is 5 years old #justsayin #radiatephx
19443|136434|2009-11-25 00:12:16|ironically my original commentary on tonight was more reflective, that is why I am focused on change instead of talking about it.
19443|136435|2009-11-24 23:18:37|if I were you, I would continue to attack everyone and make it personal because that is exactly what phx needs!!!
19443|136436|2009-11-24 23:17:20|I don't give a crap about anything except me?  Sorry your think that, my focus has always been community.
19443|136437|2009-11-24 23:10:05|damn, what is your problem?  pointing out incomes of couples, you have some serious issues to deal with #savephxandshutuptdhurst
19443|136438|2009-11-24 23:06:48|Seriously....what is your plan of action?  I would gladly support and do anything to help...but that is not YOUR goal is it mr PR!
19443|136439|2009-11-24 23:05:29|So what is the plan after tonight?  Will you be following up with everyone to something being done or do you just talk about it?
19443|136440|2009-11-24 23:04:00|its call having to go to class, making change not just talking about it, besides not sure anything I can say about parking meters
19443|136441|2009-11-24 22:24:46|ha ha started 45min late, 1st bitch was about parking meters, I don't need group therapy, I am making the change I want!
19443|136442|2009-11-24 21:42:39|hilarious: a bunch of spectators whining about needing more spectale. Meanwhile, the city is alive and well #radiatephx
19443|136443|2009-11-24 19:41:30|#radiatephoenix good turn out..sorry I had to bug out early, changing is a full time job #justsayin
19443|136444|2009-11-24 19:35:17|We need bloggers? Where is when you need them?
19443|136445|2009-11-24 19:33:26|We are marshall oh wait, we are Phoenix :) #radiatephx good discussion on phx and our internal problems...
19443|136446|2009-11-24 19:30:41|because they live to far away and/ or don't care?  #justsayin
19443|136447|2009-11-24 19:29:14|Maybe the problem with phx is the very people who talk all the time about what's wrong with phx #justsayin #myselfincluded
19443|136448|2009-11-24 16:37:01|Hello world!
19443|136449|2009-11-24 15:20:06|I am thankful for the ability to #critique :)

33383|137841|2009-10-23 01:30:12|Leaving for Boston in about 10 hours. Seems like we just got back from the east coast a couple of days ago. Oh, that's because we did. Crap.

33423|137853|2009-11-04 22:46:52|Two outs.
33423|137854|2009-11-04 22:43:34|One out.

33423|137861|2009-11-04 22:26:44|Yes, that broken-bat single with Torre mistakenly playing the infield in is quite a blight on Rivera's record.
33423|137862|2009-11-04 22:16:36|Well, here comes Mariano Rivera, the greatest pitcher in the history of the game.

33423|137869|2009-11-09 12:47:09|No, I knew they had 3G modems. Just galling that they're rolling out new higher-speed ones before enabling iPhone tethering.
33423|137870|2009-11-09 12:08:15|That's a good way to put it. I also think Google is proving that undesign is better than bad design.
33423|137871|2009-11-09 00:49:56|At current growth rate, eventually Apple will need Verizon to keep growing. And Verizon will need iPhone to get network switchers.
33423|137872|2009-11-09 00:48:16|Won't happen in next few months, maybe not 2010, but the trend is clear. Unless iPhone slows down, it's inevitable.
33423|137873|2009-11-09 00:06:59|I'm not saying Verizon should put all their eggs in Droid basket. Just all their holiday 2009 anti-iPhone eggs.

33423|137886|2009-11-07 11:07:29|Tried to buy Business Card Reader, but it requires OS 3.1, so, alas, I can't use it.
33423|137887|2009-11-07 11:04:03|Also: let you jot notes for when and where you got the card. The sort of things I usually write in pen on the back of paper cards.
33423|137888|2009-11-07 11:03:31|The app I'm thinking of should both parse text through OCR, for future searching and creating contacts, and also save the image of the card.
33423|137889|2009-11-07 11:02:30|Business Card Reader is sort of close. File it under maybe.
33423|137890|2009-11-07 11:02:06|Cardreader is along the lines I'm thinking about. $8, though, and most of the reviews state that it doesn't work.
33423|137891|2009-11-07 10:58:37|Not Evernote.
33423|137892|2009-11-07 10:30:47|Is there a killer iPhone app for photographing and OCRing business cards? If not, there ought to be.

33423|137897|2009-11-06 18:13:24|I didn't say hypocrite, but it's a glaring omission not to mention that ads on NYT.com itself blink and animate.
33423|137898|2009-11-06 18:10:41|I'll bet tons of normal people do. Zillions. And I'll bet they're the sort who are mostly likely not to have heard of Droid yet
33423|137899|2009-11-06 17:35:48|That's great. I recommend you invest heavily in AA stock.
33423|137900|2009-11-06 15:20:30|How many such reviews have you seen?
33423|137901|2009-11-06 14:12:09|Interesting! So maybe the explicit Straighten tool in the Android version is a workaround for not using multi-touch for this.

33423|137936|2009-11-19 21:43:29|The email from DF readers who disagree with me is almost always delightfully reasonable. Not these App Store defenders.
33423|137937|2009-11-19 21:40:09|The blind-defenders I hear from are almost never developers themselves.
33423|137938|2009-11-19 21:28:53|I strongly suspect Apple got rid of the checkout lines in their stores not to improve it but to eliminate perception of queues.
33423|137939|2009-11-19 21:26:52|The emails from die-hard there's-nothing-wrong-with-the-App-Store defenders are the worst tripe I've ever gotten in DF history.
33423|137940|2009-11-19 20:36:30|My quote from Graham was slightly off, based on a draft of the article I read. Took it out for a few minutes while fixing. Back now.
33423|137941|2009-11-19 20:26:45|I'm skeptical but hopeful. Don't mean to be overly negative. I'd like to start running it in VMware.
33423|137942|2009-11-19 16:41:37|I missed most of the live video stream of today's Chrome OS event. Is there a downloadable version of it?
33423|137943|2009-11-19 16:21:57|Jitkoff's in this concept video too: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ57xzo287U
33423|137944|2009-11-19 16:16:17|So there's no Chrome OS download we can run in VMware?
33423|137945|2009-11-19 16:15:21|Example account in this screenshot suggests that Nicholas Jitkoff, creator of Quicksilver, is working on Chrome OS: http://xrl.us/bgcwn3
33423|137946|2009-11-19 13:19:54|And the last one where they took more than three questions was...?
33423|137947|2009-11-19 13:11:59|This is why Apple doesn't do Q+A sessions like this. Who are these people?
33423|137948|2009-11-19 13:05:47|Now there's a guy asking if you can run Eclipse.
33423|137949|2009-11-19 13:01:49|Q+A for the Chrome OS event is painful. Some in the press can't get it into their heads that you can't install binary apps or plugins.
33423|137950|2009-11-19 12:33:22|It would if one got popular.
33423|137951|2009-11-19 12:33:00|Good one, thanks.
33423|137952|2009-11-18 20:29:58|Queued up for tomorrow, thanks.
33423|137953|2009-11-18 17:48:47|Nah. But mainly because I tend to unfollow frequent RT-ers.

33423|137956|2009-11-18 16:32:22|I'm tagging them as I go, so that ought to be possible.
33423|137957|2009-11-18 15:20:48|I'm sure you'll be unsurprised to hear that I went back and forth several times on the definite article. Sorta like the sound of it.
33423|137958|2009-11-18 15:03:45|Either send them here, or email me at the DF contacts page address.
33423|137959|2009-11-18 14:43:23|Thanks for all the good words on Fraidy Cats. Tips and links welcome.
33423|137960|2009-11-18 14:24:06|Very good point. I'll give it some thought. In the meantime, the not-afraid headlines end without the of the terrorists.

33423|137970|2009-11-16 12:02:48|Doubt that'll happen. Apple doesn't want to let devs know what they can get away with. The rule is simply don't use private APIs.
33423|137971|2009-11-16 11:30:22|I honestly don't know exactly what it flags. I have reason to believe that it is a serious tool, not simplistic.
33423|137972|2009-11-16 10:14:57|Yup: Apple recently started running apps through a static analysis tool to look for private API calls.
33423|137973|2009-11-16 09:07:03|Just updated to add a parenthetical pointing that out.
33423|137974|2009-11-15 23:55:52|That's how they're going to do it starting Q1 2011 (I think), but for now, they defer it all. No separation between HW/SW.

33423|137980|2009-11-13 14:44:21|No, because I know, from at least a dozen other developers, that re-submitting and hoping for another reviewer often works.
33923|137981|2009-11-04 15:02:07|Hello world!
33923|137982|2009-11-04 15:01:02|You bet, please feel free to feature it.
33923|137983|2009-11-04 13:38:51|I've had access to the beta for a while now.
33923|137984|2009-11-04 13:38:35|Likewise, very much looking forward to being in Idaho tomorrow!
33923|137985|2009-11-04 12:21:33|I made it about as dim as I could make it, subtle enough to remind. I'll definitely remove soon.
33923|137986|2009-11-04 11:00:38|That's the HTML5 doctype. Still have some legacy XHTML in the markup that we need to clean up.
33923|137987|2009-11-04 10:58:16|Care to provide some advice? Would love to hear.
33923|137988|2009-11-04 10:40:31|Wow, thanks for pointing that one out (Opera). We're on it.
33923|137989|2009-11-04 10:35:31|We probably *could* make it work in IE6, but the ROI/hassle totally isn't worth it. Only 2.5% of our audience uses IE6.
33923|137990|2009-11-04 10:34:09|thank you, typo fixed
33923|137991|2009-11-04 10:32:47|Thanks for remarks, all, re: Authentic Jobs. Lots of feedback to respond to. Always amazed how many little things pointed out post-launch.

33923|137999|2009-11-03 00:13:17|I don't understand why the designing with Photoshop vs. Fireworks vs. HTML debates continue. Do whatever works best for *you*, people.

33923|138005|2009-11-02 12:43:53|This is interesting. Some of you mentioned http://spoon.net/browsers/ which allows you to run virtual copies of IE (Windows only?)
33923|138006|2009-11-02 12:28:04|.I figure I'll eventually have to do the same to have a proper setup (separate VMs for each IE), but for now giving this a try.

33923|138014|2009-10-30 12:18:38|For reference, IE6 accounts for roughly 2.5% of Authentic Jobs' traffic.

35293|138229|2009-11-11 10:35:11|Sorry to hear about Adobe's layoffs. I hope it's a new start; still, letting 9% of the workforce go means some good people are out of a job.
35293|138230|2009-11-10 19:43:34|When you're peeing, coughing is like holding the B button in Super Mario.
35293|138231|2009-11-10 18:39:16|You might want to talk to about that.
35293|138232|2009-11-10 18:36:55|Unfortunately, the poof ends up looking like an ink stain when it's black.
35293|138233|2009-11-10 18:25:04|Oh. I just learned what the possibly disturbing mission in Modern Welfare 2 is.

35293|138236|2009-11-10 16:18:14|Ummm yeah, except I can't retweet from the website yo.
35293|138237|2009-11-10 15:14:24|Unfortunately, the poof looks like ink splatter when it's all black (which it has to be for the Safari-toolbar style)
35293|138238|2009-11-10 13:35:39|Le Petit Dummy's pay-per-feature biz model is interesting, but it makes for a very confrontational, car-salesy first-run experience.
35293|138239|2009-11-10 13:18:25|Can't have a word button in the toolbar - if the button labels are on, it would say Clear Clear :)
35293|138240|2009-11-10 11:51:33|I used to be a skeptic about the paranormal, but then the IKEA receipt I needed was the last one in the giant pile. The VERY LAST ONE.
35293|138241|2009-11-09 21:26:09|I think what I'll miss most of all when IKEA fully switches to Verdana is Futura's beautiful numeral 2. Farewell, deucey.

35293|138243|2009-11-09 17:53:35|Err incredibly enough, the blurry iChat gripper is gone in 10.6.2 here (your mileage may vary.)
35293|138244|2009-11-09 16:41:24|Any specific improvement you'd like to see?
35293|138245|2009-11-09 13:33:47|That Verizon & Apple need each other is a blessing (what a fit!) & a curse (negotiations prolonged by each saying they have the upper hand)

35293|138247|2009-11-09 11:33:45|I'd love to hear just *how* good it is. I don't think I've ever had *amazing* ramen (I've had amazing lasagna worth the 12-hours.)
35293|138248|2009-11-09 00:38:30|Reminds me of the common belief that a company would fire a high-salary employee over a gaffe in an email or on a website.
35293|138249|2009-11-08 21:16:28|Indeed!
35293|138250|2009-11-08 21:16:11|Ah, that's still my mad-scientist avatar from Halloween.

35293|138252|2009-11-08 14:17:02|Praying for my friend Alex, who's in his first Animaniacs Anonymous meeting. Stay strong!
35293|138253|2009-11-08 13:21:27|That's what you get for using a low-end computer like Mac Pro. Have you seen these iMacs they have now?
35293|138254|2009-11-08 00:01:41|OMG Lowes.com is down too!

35293|138256|2009-11-28 12:27:17|I'm sure you know this, but Apple sets the terms for one, and the music industry for the other. Imagine an RIAA-run app store!
35293|138257|2009-11-28 12:11:00|KitchenAid & Cuisinart both makes great ones; don't bother with other brands. I like KA. Skip mini models.

35293|138259|2009-11-27 23:13:27|Uh, why is there a line of teens on dates waiting to see The Road? It's not about Aragorn's journey, people.
35293|138260|2009-11-27 23:11:44|Gift Organizer helps you keep track of other people's wish lists and gifting occasions.
35293|138261|2009-11-27 22:14:56|I'm no CEO, but it seems to me Amazon should put an iPhone version of their Gift Organizer very high on the priority list.
35293|138262|2009-11-27 22:00:58|Downtown Portland is a zoo right now. (Yup, I'm feeling better!)
35293|138263|2009-11-27 21:21:06|Really, really close to emailing a 13-year old whose racist and homophobic YouTube comments I ran into. Somebody talk me out of this.
35293|138264|2009-11-27 19:10:38|Now that's interesting. Too bad it's Photoshop-only, but that would work for most of my needs. Thanks!
35293|138265|2009-11-27 17:42:11|YeahÂ¦ not all that helpful when you're looking for one image in a folder of hundreds.
35293|138266|2009-11-27 17:07:27|Good luck :)
35293|138267|2009-11-27 17:02:03|Yes. It's the worst version-control app I've used.
35293|138268|2009-11-27 16:58:00|(I admit I don't know if Versions does anything like a thumbnail view for images.)
35293|138269|2009-11-27 16:57:28|To be honest, I use it for code projects, but it's never worked for graphics for me. I need a thumbnail-y store for images!
35293|138270|2009-11-27 16:55:03|+ - Congrats! Really super-happy for you bunch of schmoopies.
35293|138271|2009-11-27 16:38:31|No, by hand, none, in Photoshop. I'm not hired, am I :(
35293|138272|2009-11-27 14:03:00|Exactly. I distrust every should which benefits the one who says it.
35293|138273|2009-11-27 13:50:17|I believe that You should follow me on Twitter is the most follower-earning wording, but it also annoys the snot out of me, so there.
35293|138274|2009-11-27 13:33:56|Sketches for iPhone is my app of choice for communication now that my throat is temporarily out of order.
35293|138275|2009-11-27 10:58:31|I'm thankful for the wife who's really bummed I sleep in the guest room because I have the flu, and for the cat who keeps me company there.
35293|138276|2009-11-26 16:36:29|who types urls? I thought people googled for everything :)
35293|138277|2009-11-26 14:12:15|Wow, didn't even think of that. Software is hard, let's draw pixels :)
35293|138278|2009-11-26 12:26:23|RightÂ¦ Not possible. Still, quicker than the App Store :) (Given a long password.)
35293|138279|2009-11-26 12:14:41|Hmmm I'm not sure I understand about the Home Screen button - can you elaborate?
35293|138280|2009-11-26 12:14:04|Since my achey liver doesn't like pain meds (acetaminophen, ibuprofen or aspirin) I'm braving this flu *cold turkey* (Happy Thanksgiving!)
35293|138281|2009-11-26 12:08:37|Agreed. A lot of improvements could be made to speed up execution in general, but touch-control lag is out of my hands.
35293|138282|2009-11-26 10:17:41|Thanks, dude. All the best to you and yours.
35293|138283|2009-11-26 06:55:18|Well it's 4am on Thanksgiving and I'm awake, describing my aches to a webpage. This is a perfect time to get ahold of a doctor, right.
35293|138284|2009-11-25 23:59:29|Well, a great day wraps up with what sure feels like H1N1. Somebody tell me you can still dork on the computer if you get the swine flu.
35293|138285|2009-11-25 22:25:25|The original Thanksgiving feast was lobster, oysters, eel, and berries. You're closer than most!
35293|138286|2009-11-25 21:21:55|I thought you didn't like themÂ¦ Hm. Now I know how people feel when I try to sell them on something by saying It's REALLY fishy!
35293|138287|2009-11-25 20:35:20|Not as far as I know (I don't know anyone with an Android phone.)
35293|138288|2009-11-25 19:45:07|Oh, just hit the URl in Safari on the desktop - it's the same page!
35293|138289|2009-11-25 19:35:56|Mmmm I'm having some delicious neck knot with rum and cinnamon right now! (Ok that didn't work did it.)
35293|138290|2009-11-25 19:11:02|Ummm not really, not right now. Sorry!
35293|138291|2009-11-25 18:01:39|If you hit the website on the desktop, it's the same page you get on the iPhone. That's all there is to it!
35293|138292|2009-11-25 17:12:30|Just hit http://mrgan.com/pieguy on your iPhone. It's a web app, so no store is involved!
35293|138293|2009-11-25 17:12:05|Not yet, since I don't feel technically skilled enough to do it, but I encourage people to dig through my code.
35293|138294|2009-11-25 17:06:03|I'm all for interoperability, but examples like Pie Guy are needed to get Mozilla to add support for new technologies!
35293|138295|2009-11-25 16:33:49|Nah - I just walk through the map data to place the tokens (those have to be dynamic) but the map itself is http://bit.ly/7zfyjr
35293|138296|2009-11-25 16:22:15|But, the map is just an image - it doesn't get redrawn anyway :)
35293|138297|2009-11-25 16:14:19|Interesting. Not sure what you meant before, though, about making a canvas for the map layer.
35293|138298|2009-11-25 16:10:17|Well, without animations, there wouldn't be much game to speak of :) If you mean the level effects, nah, they're not very taxing.
35293|138299|2009-11-25 16:04:39|By the way, the one and only offered invaluable help with Pie Guy. That's right, I got advice from the Sparkle guy!
35293|138300|2009-11-25 16:02:50|That is correct. Pie Guy's graphics are (layer-backed) CSS transformations and animations.
35293|138301|2009-11-25 15:33:16|YeahÂ¦ It'll only work nicely on a 3GS. Quite a step up performance-wise!
35293|138302|2009-11-25 15:18:56|Not at all, go nuts! I'm not a good programmer, but I hope I can inspire some great ones to take the webapp challenge!
35293|138303|2009-11-25 14:58:39|I'd say Â¦ 100 hours, maybe?
35293|138304|2009-11-25 14:02:47|I'm afraid this calls for more than just Webkit. Also, I don't know anyone with an Android phone, so, hard to test.
35293|138305|2009-11-25 13:59:16|Sorry, it will probably only run smoothly on a 3GS. Reason to upgradeÂ¦? :P
35293|138306|2009-11-25 13:40:45|Swipe fast :)
35293|138307|2009-11-25 13:37:51|Oh boy, and how :) Feel free to dig through my (embarrassing) code!
35293|138308|2009-11-25 13:37:04|Sorry - 3GS made a significant jump in Webkit performance, so this is only possible on a 3GS (given my code skills, anyway.)
35293|138309|2009-11-25 13:36:22|Not me! :) I think web apps are neat, and since I don't speak Cocoa, I do what I can. Web apps *are* underrated, though!
35293|138310|2009-11-25 13:30:45|From the Pie Guy Department of Perhaps-Not-Obvious: it works when you're offline, too!
35293|138311|2009-11-25 13:30:02|Thanks!
35293|138312|2009-11-25 13:29:38|Which theory is that?
35293|138313|2009-11-25 13:29:17|Network shouldn't matter, actually - it's all stored locally. Do youhave a 3G? I only tested on a 3GS. Significant difference!
35293|138314|2009-11-30 18:53:23|Oddly, I don't think I've ever heard a poetry reading I liked better than the written word.
35293|138315|2009-11-30 17:19:22|It's hard not to overhear every word and nuance on a crowded bus :)
35293|138316|2009-11-30 17:14:20|Stil amazed with pickup attempts I see on the bus. Guy asks girl for her actual *phone*, to get her number from. (She gives it to him.)

35293|138318|2009-11-30 12:40:05|How long until the screener guys come out with cameras that can capture 3D movie projections? :)
35293|138319|2009-11-30 12:28:36|I don't want to have to punch you as I'm walking through downtown Portland, but I'll do it, I will.

35293|138324|2009-11-30 10:29:54|The CrunchPad may be a nonexistent, totally predicted failure of a nonproduct, but it's one of the ten bet such nonproducts in 2009, right?

35293|138326|2009-11-29 12:41:10|It gets worse, in that some maintain that wheat is really bad for you and *no one* should eat it.
35293|138327|2009-11-29 12:11:04|Tried Firehouse, NE Portland; forgettable small plates, but the Neapolitan pizza is excellent.

45733|138916|2009-11-21 18:32:49|ohh I so want to be there!
45733|138917|2009-11-21 18:28:46|you're right, its a great blogging tool.  I don't, however, think a great blogging tool is synonymous w/ a great CMS.
45733|138918|2009-11-21 17:59:04|Truth is sometimes a hard pill for people to swallow... trolls are born in such circumstances.
45733|138919|2009-11-21 17:44:34|I am afraid so, pinky. :)
45733|138920|2009-11-21 17:40:30|Hello world!
45733|138921|2009-11-21 17:39:22|the sad part is they dont really understand the diff between the UX events vs the IA ones vs the IXD vs..
45733|138922|2009-11-21 17:36:46|birthdays should be like a holiday, you get the day off no matter what. If its on the weekend, you get Friday off :)
45733|138923|2009-11-21 17:34:09|what did I do now? :P
45733|138924|2009-11-21 17:33:30|they are starting to reach out to the local groups.. but we're still lucky to find more than 2 at a given event.
45733|138925|2009-11-21 17:30:31|yes, and his fees where almost as high as other recruiters :)
45733|138926|2009-11-21 17:29:55|I prefer GSD... GTD is a process that can sometimes get in the way of GSD (unless you have mastered GTD & its second nature). :)
45733|138927|2009-11-21 17:27:47|I agree, can't complain about the uninformed if we can't, as you called it, DTDT.
45733|138928|2009-11-21 17:25:32|ahh I thought you meant do the damn thing ...also something we need to fix in our industry :P  #getshitdone
45733|138929|2009-11-21 17:23:33|at least it wasnt 0 tip. Former client did this & waitress ran out & sarcastically thanked him. Dont work with them anymore. :)
45733|138930|2009-11-21 17:21:58|i am not sure I follow you there.. what do you mean?
45733|138931|2009-11-21 17:20:18|I'd rather invest the money that would have gone into the fee into the employee to ensure they dont just poached a year later.
45733|138932|2009-11-21 17:19:27|I can list several recruiters who I think are good.. still not going to pay a years salary of candidate to them as a fee.
45733|138933|2009-11-21 17:18:12|Hire a temp to DTDT (assuming: time, effort, & matching qualifiers, etc). Interviewing takes time but you have to do that either way.
45733|138934|2009-11-21 17:15:52|haha good point! :D
45733|138935|2009-11-21 17:15:36|its also about paying decent salaries so they dont get poached :)
45733|138936|2009-11-21 17:13:41|I once was hired by a recruiter. Their entire business model is based on that fee (sometimes 1-2 years total salary of candidate).
45733|138937|2009-11-21 17:02:03|I hate to say it but we can find better qualified talent in the market than they can via twitter & w/o that ridiculous fee.
45733|138938|2009-11-21 16:59:22|I have to agree with  No broad-sweeping assumptions about the other gender please :P
45733|138939|2009-11-21 16:56:27|what amazes me is the other side of the deal; the business owner looking to hire using a recruiter. That is some spendy fee. Why?
45733|138940|2009-11-21 16:52:20|Interesting take on dealing with recruiters. I prefer to pass the info to ideal candidates vs giving info to recruiter.
45733|138941|2009-11-21 16:46:12|Happy birthday and last but not least, :D

51573|139561|2009-11-10 14:18:51|The source tweet should appear in your timeline, and you should see Retweeted by you beneath it.

52833|139587|2009-09-11 21:09:00|Watching a little Bill Maher. I think I can take a break now that I've finished dusting and vacuuming the house.
52833|139588|2009-09-14 19:09:00|The kitchen is clean and I'm sitting down to watch some MNF. I guess I'd like to see the Patriots win, even though I hate their throwbacks.
52833|139589|2009-09-14 20:09:00|A little surprised that Buffalo is leading 17 -10 against the Patriots. Not what I would have predicted.

52833|139594|2009-09-14 20:09:00|a wise decision indeed.
52833|139595|2009-09-14 21:09:00|No way! Buffalo had the win and they just crapped it down their leg w/ a fumbleya. The Pats get a lucky break...can they cash in on it?
52833|139596|2009-09-14 21:09:00|we got a helluva game. This is how I like MNF.
52833|139597|2009-09-14 21:09:00|Awesome finish to MNF.  Now I can go to bed, because there's no way I can stay up for the late game.
52833|139598|2009-09-14 21:09:00|cool. Reisner has one guy left in our matchup. He needs McFadden to get 35 points for the win.
52833|139599|2009-09-14 21:09:00|Okay, so I lied...I'm still up watching football, and I can't believe my eyes. The Raiders just marched down and scored a TD.

52833|139602|2009-09-14 22:09:00|yeah, I know. I'm waiting for that LTE upgrade they keep talking about. Then maybe...just maybe the iPhone will follow.

53983|139673|2009-11-17 23:42:51|I would have used Knob Creek, but I'm about out & an ABC store trip was a no go. Drastic measures were taken!

72293|140834|2009-09-09 20:09:00|I think it's a little weird that the Top Model contestants are posing as sexy versions of their three year old selves. Kinda creepy.
72293|140835|2009-09-09 21:09:00|E found a Dora toy and ran around all night saying Dora very clearly. Funny since we don't watch Dora or have any other Dora stuff.
72293|140836|2009-09-10 21:09:00|wow. what happens around there after i leave? no more candy in the newsroom!
72293|140837|2009-09-10 21:09:00|Liked CW's new Vampire Diaries show. Good week of new programming on the CW.
72293|140838|2009-09-10 21:09:00|Seems like SC has been in the news regularly ever since we moved away. Some really nutty stories/people outta there.
72293|140839|2009-09-11 07:09:00|Eliza's woken up cranky all week throwing tantrums for no apparent reason. Guess she's not a morning person either.
72293|140840|2009-09-11 09:09:00|Made it nearly a year w/out a Houston fender bender. End of streak today when I got rear ended 2 blocks from work. Only a lil damage, tho.
72293|140841|2009-09-11 10:09:00|More job candidates today and next week. Busy, busy, busy around here as we hurry to get people hired before 5/5:30 news starts in 2 weeks.
72293|140842|2009-09-12 09:09:00|Hate waking up on a Saturday to a your mailbox has exceeded specified size limits message. Why does that always happen over the wknd?
72293|140843|2009-09-12 09:09:00|Eliza searched the house this morning for LuLew even though she went home a week ago. Sweet and sad at the same time.
72293|140844|2009-09-12 17:09:00|Just bought E a new wardrobe. She's sprouted up & is too tall for all her clothes! Got a bunch of cute stuff including some high-top sneaks.
72293|140845|2009-09-13 12:09:00|Just enjoyed a lovely Sunday pedicure. Color du jour is OPI's 20 Candles on the Cake. It's a striking one! Good choice for fall.
72293|140846|2009-09-13 14:09:00|Finally made it to Little Bigs. Love its simplicity. Great sliders, fries and beer.
72293|140847|2009-09-14 14:09:00|Another job candidate today. Tidied up the car which included hiding E's potty-on-the-go in trunk. No way to explain that to a stranger.
72293|140848|2009-09-14 21:09:00|Kanye West is too much. Crying on Leno? Seriously. That guy has got to get a grip.
72293|140849|2009-09-15 09:09:00|Kinda sorta felt like fall here this morning and I liked it.
72293|140850|2009-09-15 10:09:00|Looks like The View's stylists tried to tame Kate Gosselin's hair. Almost didn't recognize her. Made me turn up volume on The View for once.
72293|140851|2009-09-15 20:09:00|JL trying to get Eliza to sleep. Not sure how sucessful the effort is as I hear her laughing and roaring like a lion in the other room.
72293|140852|2009-09-15 22:09:00|Feeling resentment towards twitter lately. Lots of posts for not going through. It just sits on the spinny circle forever and never updates.
72293|140853|2009-09-15 22:09:00|Oh, I love that that one just went through! You showed me twitter.

72343|140883|2009-11-02 18:45:34|a 40% share increase in the two weeks following a loss sounds like a good indicator of a momentum shift to me.

99723|141901|2009-11-20 13:27:04|Ooh, what's goin' on this evening? We'll see in any case - been out and about a little much lately. ;)
99723|141902|2009-11-20 13:24:07|Yea, mine is broken. Seems to just be an oddity, but I guess that's appropriate. ;)
99723|141903|2009-11-20 13:16:35|Hello world!
99723|141904|2009-11-20 12:57:24|Sampling how many geo-tweets there are - so far, 15 out of 50,000 from Twitter API sample stream.
99723|141905|2009-11-20 12:55:54|I somehow read that as A = A taco. I was confused, but not anymore.
99723|141906|2009-11-20 12:55:36|No. :-p
99723|141907|2009-11-20 12:53:22|Strawpedoing a bottle of wine is often stated as the ultimate strawpedo test -- Sooo....
99723|141908|2009-11-20 12:52:26|Isn't that called a strawpedo? ;)
99723|141909|2009-11-20 12:31:47|Twitter COO says new advertising biz model on Twitter will be fascinating and non-traditional. Color me skeptical.
99723|141910|2010-03-04 05:23:45|Once iPhone apps get pushed out w/support, I guess we'll see.
99723|141911|2009-11-20 12:18:28|That's the thing, I don't think most people will. Tho Twitter has hints for how to address user privacy. Wrong approach.
99723|141912|2009-11-20 12:14:09|First, the new geo API scares me from a privacy perspective. Second, I'm already seeing spammy tweets on it.
99723|141913|2009-11-19 13:54:16|Live streaming. From freaking space! space walk live! http://bit.ly/HPn4
99723|141914|2009-11-19 12:40:20|It'd be cool if I could see retweets from my friends since they won't bubble to the top anymore. Retweets by others shows zilch.
99723|141915|2010-03-04 05:23:45|Problem's on my end. key :user_id, index => true - note the lack of String.
99723|141916|2009-11-19 04:57:34|Yea, I see it. I guess it's just going to be buried until clients start supporting it. It was good ad-hoc feedback for me...
99723|141917|2010-03-04 05:23:45|All that said, I'm much more likely to retweet something now b/c it doesn't really mean much.
99723|141918|2009-11-19 04:24:00|To Twitter, a retweet is nothing more than a means to obtain better tracking and identification of popular tweets.
99723|141919|2009-11-19 04:23:14|I also just tried to retweet myself via mild hackery. It didn't work, shame.
99723|141920|2009-11-19 04:17:10|I used to know when people retweeted my stuff thanks to mentions. Now I guess it's like a favorite, that disappears into oblivion.
99723|141921|2009-11-19 03:42:16|Heh, I actually love those - simply because they haven't planned for the likes of us folk. And are entirely broken as such.
99723|141922|2009-11-19 03:41:41|Very much agreed. Sadly advertising and sponsorship is a huge revenue generator on the web and, as such, takes a lot of precedence. :(
99723|141923|2009-11-19 03:28:57|The thing I hate the most is when I visit a site and the absolute first content I see is an ad. I understand the necessity, but despite
99723|141924|2009-11-19 03:12:11|Completely detracts from the picture that I went to the site to visit. Ugh is right. Too bad their only revenue is via ads.
99723|141925|2009-11-19 03:11:31|Also, while I'm in a complaining mood - Dear engadget, the top 250 pixels of your site is completely distracting. Just the facts, jack.
99723|141926|2009-11-19 03:02:04|Dear Twitpic - please don't show me ugly-ass teeth on your site. kthx.

99723|141932|2009-11-18 17:44:53|Tweetie. Done.
99723|141933|2009-11-18 17:44:34|You know how sometimes you look at something and think they did it right? That's what hit me with the new http://tweetvite.com
99723|141934|2009-11-18 17:37:32|Came across a little oddity with mongomapper. http://gist.github.com/238386 (Tho it could be misunderstanding on my side)
99723|141935|2009-11-18 16:54:07|Hm, with the new retweets...does that mean something will only show up in search once, no matter how many times it gets retweeted? Assuming.

99723|141946|2009-11-18 12:13:22|Were I part of the retweet beta, I would retweet that.

101143|141967|2009-10-18 07:38:08|Playing one of the top 10 toughest ranked public golf courses in the country today (Tobacco Road). Adjusting expectations accordingly.
101143|141968|2009-10-17 21:05:12|Just lost a bet on baseball rules (I think). Didn't realize that tagging a runner out when they have to advance is considered a force out.
101143|141969|2009-10-17 17:26:13|Took 2 days but I finally shot a good nine (41) and took some money on the process. It's cold here in North Carolina.
101143|141970|2009-10-15 16:06:34|I have 3G devices from Verizon, AT&T and Sprint. None of them get reasonable data service at our condo in Pinehurst, NC. Maybe a good thing.
101143|141971|2009-10-15 10:59:33|Just watched a guy start going the wrong way on a moving walk, and kept going for a ways - I think to avoid looking foolish.
