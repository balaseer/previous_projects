\subsection*{Overview}

This is a shell program that executes all the common shell commands and keeps track of running jobs.

\subsection*{Manifest}

\hyperlink{mydash_8c}{mydash.\+c} -\/ main class that executes all the code \hyperlink{mydash_8h}{mydash.\+h} -\/ header file for main class \hyperlink{jobs_8c}{jobs.\+c} -\/ class that contains functions for jobs \hyperlink{jobs_8h}{jobs.\+h} -\/ header file for \hyperlink{jobs_8c}{jobs.\+c}

This program also links with all the files in p0 (linked list)

\subsection*{Building the project}

From the p1 folder, type make and press enter.

\subsection*{Features and usage}

This is a shell program that accepts commands such as\+: ls, cd, who, jobs, tree, etc.

It allows the user to navigate through directories and run jobs.

\subsection*{Testing}

Please see my Test\+Considerations.\+txt file to see how I tested this program in depth.

\subsubsection*{Valgrind}

I used\+: valgrind --leak-\/check=full ./mydash

to check and everything looks fine!

\subsubsection*{Known Bugs}

My cd command is not working correctly because of how I parsing the line. every cd command takes you back to the home directory because the parser forces argv\mbox{[}1\mbox{]} to be N\+U\+L\+L.

\subsection*{Discussion}

This was definitely a challenging project. exec-\/ing the child proccess took me a while to learn. The other command(exit, cd, empty command, history, jobs) were more straight forward at the beginning, but once I learned about exec it was really easy.

I faced a few segfaults at the beginning of this project because of how I used some loops and also because I had some invalid reads. I had a memory leak as well because I was freeing something in the wrong place. It took me a few days of debugging to get everything right.

Overall, this project was difficult but it really taught me a lot. I have a much beter understanding of proccesses and how a shell works.

\subsection*{Sources used}

I used a lot of sources for this project. manpages, discussion boards, github, stackoverflow, etc. I didn\textquotesingle{}t have previous knowledge of a lot of this so I was looking for as much help as I could find. The sources helped me learn shortcuts and how to access pointer and structs again since it has been a while since ive taken C\+S253.
