## Current Project Status:

All of the requirements for this challenge work except for one. From the user interface, no more than one
dependent can be added. This is due to the fact that I could not seem to figure out how to add Django
form dynamically in a correct manner. I am adding them to the UI but I am not able to fetch the user input.
I got very close to figuring it out, but had to give up due to time constraints. The back-end of
this project, however, works exactly as intended.

## Future Improvements:

This is my first time working with Django. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to try and learn something new.
It was both good and bad. Good in the sense that I got the opportunity to expand my knowledge and learn
something new. Bad in the sense that I could not finish this challenge 100%. But I will take this as a
learning opportunity nonetheless.

Here are some improvements that I will as I keep building this:
- Incorporate dynamic forms for Dependents.
- Incorporate generic views.
- Learn how to generate automated tests for UI
- write more comprehensive test and use testing frameworks.
- Maybe implement a BenefitCostAdjuster class to handle benefit costs in a cleaner manner.
- Implement a search bar to search for employees(there is currently one that does nothing).
